Slippery Slope	Getting 12k is 1.5-2h of grinding.  You screwed up. Nobody decided that training TV Def was a good idea but you.   I don't see any reason why there should be any leeway here.   What's next? People being allowed to refight a luma because they accidentally killed it / ran from it?    Re-picking your starter because you decided you made the wrong decision?   Reverse a breeding process because people forgot to put a strain in?   Why not just implement a safe feature if you cater to the carelessness of people
Slippery Slope	Jesus you guys are actually beyond saving at this point. Time to sit back and watch The Left on it's slippery slope to good ole Communism, enjoy your famine.
Slippery Slope	It will annoy and irritate the BLM and local law enforcement and put future permits at risk.
Slippery Slope	Yes, and if we're going to convict nurses and doctors of murder for being overwhelmed, we should also be convicting members of the public who are flouting the warnings and rules put in place to stem the spread, as well as the politicians and talking heads who downplay the seriousness of the virus.  This is a public failure of our systems, for which we are collectively guilty.
Slippery Slope	Because they definitely only want to go after the trans people and its definitely not the first step to surveillance and punish people in our community
Slippery Slope	Socialism is only a stepping stone to communism. Both are failures of the last century and killed more people and destroyed more cultures than fascism.
Slippery Slope	"Going to get downvoted,but just follow my logic here and let's see where it goes.  But if they weren't in school, and they were at home... right? Then who would be responsible for feeding them? Would that be their parents? And if their parents were at home, instead of at work making money, then how would they afford the rent, clothes, food, etc?  School is a free babysitter for the working class, but not a free lunch. If you can't afford to make a salami sandwich for your kid and send it with him to school, then you can't afford to make him one at home, right?   I'm not saying that the  public education system couldn't be asked to provide lunches, but it definitely shouldn't be expected. With that same logic, why don't we provide parents free lunch at work, and homeless people need free lunches too. The argument for ""free"" stuff only ends poorly."
Slippery Slope	If you normalize forced government injections what happens when the government turns against it's own people like governments have for all of recorded history?  What injections might they force on people in the future 'for their own good'?
Slippery Slope	Do anti-vax parents of children barred from public school get a tax break for not receiving public services theyre paying in to? I think prohibiting use of public services is a slippery slope (I understand that slippery slope is often called a bad argument). Should we deny public police service from people who are anti police activists? What other groups of people who pay into the system should be denied service? I am not anti-vax by any means. Vasectomy to ensure never have to worry about kiddos, just a counter argument to see what people think about the act of denying public services to particular groups.
Slippery Slope	...and who makes the determination that it was natural causes? Someone qualified would have to do that, since self-induced abortions can look like miscarriages.  What the OP is essentially stating is that if you really believe that abortion must be treated as murder, then you are also arguing for other more potentially ominous things you may have not really thought of.
Slippery Slope	You may think these are extreme examples.  And yes they probably are!  But there is a psychological effect called foot in the door, once you head down a road at what point do you stop?  The easiest option for quick information/imposing rules is to assume its not ok and work backwards from there.  - dont lean over anyone when having a conversation, pull up a chair - if you see someone from work outside the traditional setting follow their lead with engaging or not. - dont say anything to a woman that you wouldnt want a guy to whisper to you.  Yes its hard to understand why you a normal guy could come across as inappropriate, but the fact is the nicest guy in the world can overstep unintentionally.  Protect yourself, your career/business and your colleagues. Be mindful
Slippery Slope	Many companies are voluntarily doing just that.  Dont need another law FORCING people to comply.   Be careful. Youre going to end up in a totalitarian state if you keep pushing governmental force.
Slippery Slope	In the next book they'll add sister and brother parents, father with 3 wives and oprhans
Slippery Slope	Completely brainwashed people. They cheer them on as they take away their liberties. If the government can shut down all of these businesses without any pushback or controversy imagine what they can get away with just a little more media support. Today I have to tell many people that they will not have employment for the next month because the state government has deemed it illegal to operate a sit down restaurant.
Slippery Slope	Millions of people should starve on the street so thousands dont die from the flu. And Im the ignorant one.
Slippery Slope	It's a slippery slope to censorship. Loathe or like him, free speech is becoming more &amp; more under threat on social media. Who's next and who decides?
Slippery Slope	I understand why people would be upset with this guy, but the FBI coming to your house and taking your shit? Get ready America this is just the beginning of regulating every bit of our lives
Slippery Slope	I'm strongly pro choice but if the government can outlaw demonstrations and protests is a slippery slope towards infringing basic rights l.
Slippery Slope	No.  2nd Ammendment. Throw that away and you throw away everything after. 3rd. 4th, 5th ...etc. I am cool with women voting.  As well as everything else. What do you want to give up?
Slippery Slope	"I have a *very* hard time with this. I'm completely on board with churches *voluntarily* cancelling their own services... but if government can order churches to close their doors due to a public health emergency, what other ""emergencies"" might be invented in the future to justify suppression of our Constitutionally-guaranteed right to free exercise of religion -- *or other rights*?"
Slippery Slope	That's what they said about income tax in 1917 - it was just supposed to generate revenue for tge war effort. Yet here we are 103 years later and we all still pay it.
Slippery Slope	"Today it's ""bury the beans"".  Tomorrow it's ""bury the bodies"".  You dodged a bullet, my friend.  You'll have to keep track of the newspapers and let us know when she finally snaps and kills someone."
Slippery Slope	Well if 10 minutes isnt bad, then surely 11 is ok.   If 11 is ok then 13 is fine.   If 13 is fine then whats wrong with 15.   You said 15 is ok, 16 is just a minute more.   Were at 16, Im finishing up and will be checked out by 18.   See how it keeps getting stretched out?????  When the goddamned sign says the store closes at 9:00 the fucking customers need to get the fuck out by 8:59. They had all day to get their shit taken care of.  At 9 0 0 youre on my time.
Slippery Slope	Same with cars and you know what maybe a second home too and also a jet they should be rights
Slippery Slope	Isn't this what they said about gays and trans before they were legalised. It will inevitably happen with pedos, I saw it coming.
Slippery Slope	I think you should stay in unless it's for groceries or a trip to the pharmacy but I don't like this one fucking bit. Are we going to have to start showing papers before we leave our houses like Nazi Germany or the Soviet Union? Ok, comrade.
Slippery Slope	Yes they are... Simple as they seem, giving this up now. Where does the line get drawn, how far will you let them go.
Slippery Slope	Police state's wet dream.
Slippery Slope	Slippery slope to have youtube start removing documentaries based on what they want you to see.  Odds are they would remove the ones you dont want them to remove.
Slippery Slope	The guy is an idiot, but he shouldn't be fired. Free speech is way more important than this guy or any other idiot. Tolerating idiots doesn't lead to authoritarianism, but dismantling liberal values in the name of fear does.
Slippery Slope	Why? They can't keep people out of their games because of their beliefs, no matter how horrible they are. If they did, it would be a suppression of free speech.  They CAN do it, because they're a private company. But they shouldn't, because that shit is a slippery slope.
Slippery Slope	Plus, I firmly believe that when vaxes become mandated--and it seems to be a matter of 'when' rather than 'if, given the number of bills being introduced/debated/voted on to eliminate ALL objections (conscientious, religious, philosophical)--then it'll only be a matter of time before other medical procedures are mandated as well.    When the government mandates what goes IN you, they'll mandate what comes OUT of you.
Slippery Slope	"If you put too many limits on the match maker, then you get increase queues.  With increased queues, you lose players. When you lose players, you lose money.  When WoT losses money, they put in new ""features"" ... like wheelies to drive revenue.  And the downward spiral is repeated.    They already show what is in the queue, so the light tank people could take some personal responsibility and cancel out / change tanks if they see the queue has waaaaaay to many light tanks in it.  No .. that is not going to happen, the only recourse is for WoT to give us longer queues and the further decline of the game.  Just saying ..."
Slippery Slope	This is why foreigners are warned, you watch right now. Some of the Chinese are gonna turn on anyone. Black, Hispanic, white or south Asian.  Get the hell out now.  How far will the CCP go? Start gunning down any suspects on the streets or in their homes?  They've already got the people turning on each other.
Slippery Slope	Americans need to stop willingly giving up their freedoms. We are on a very slippery slope. Just because you have nothing to hide doesnt mean the government has the right to know everything.
Slippery Slope	Grad students are part of the union and that union agreed to terms with the UC system. What is stopping students from other UC schools from breaking the agreement and striking over anything else? From the perspective of the UC administration, do you see how caving to the UCSC strike would open the door to further wildcat strikes?
Slippery Slope	It's a slippery slope to communism,  as well as it not working very well as an economic system in general
Slippery Slope	Look man I like Bernie as much as the next guy and Im no fan of CNN but /r/politics is going fucking crazy. Theres a way to be critical of the media without conspiracy theories and victim complexes. This is the kind of slippery slope that leads to bullshit like the Jewish question.
Slippery Slope	2012 We just want to get married and have the same rights as everyone else!  Ok. Of course that's neccessary.  2017 Children should be transitioned as soon as possible. Parents who interfere should be charged with child abuse!!!  No hold on...  2020 Your children should be watching BBC porn and we'll moderate with a FAQ board that totally isn't filled with perverted pedophiles grooming your children.  ...  Yea no slippery slope whatsoever. Nope. Shit like this is why trump's gonna win again.
Slippery Slope	"If Trump can set the bar for what a president can ""get away with"" doesn't that make the next one who pushes the boundaries of breaking the law further until they start committing genocide and everyone thinks its okay?"
Slippery Slope	I hope everyone here arguing against this is okay with being detained by BPD for violating federal drug laws when they buy weed.
Slippery Slope	Thats how it starts... next thing you know were being scored on things like how polite we are in public settings.
Slippery Slope	Not that bad compared to some of the other shit on this sub. But memes like this can be a gateway drug to deeper depravity.
Slippery Slope	Great. Guns are banned! *Maybe* knife crime will creep up a little. We'll just ban knives too!  Great. Knives are banned! *Maybe* Assaults with weapons like clubs will creep up a little. We'll just ban sticks too!  Great. Sticks are banned! *Maybe* Assaults will creep up a little. We'll just ban physical movement too!  There. Everyone is safe.
Slippery Slope	"""The bill is a separate measure from House Bill 64, which is a proposed corporate income tax on companies with over 100 shareholders. House Bill 147 would impose a four percent income tax on earnings over $200,000.""  Ey, I could probably get behind this.  Let's make all those billionaires in Teton county pay the bills.  On the other hand, I know slopes are slippery and if you give a bear a pancake, he ganna ask for syrup."
Slippery Slope	Ontario has 5,000 and possible jail time for tresspasing on rail roads currently.    This just seems like it's more of that.    My only fear is different goverments will use this to introduce fines for things they don't like.    IE pro abortion groups protesting near hospital - major fine.   Protesting near a private company doing something you disagree with - fine.   Pro / anti lgbt protests - major fine.   This could head down a slippery slope quick.
Irrelevant Authority	Hahah, I'm a nurse and it's SO annoying. I keep getting ridiculous phone calls from friends and family and it's true what they say, common sense isn't very common now a days. Haha
Irrelevant Authority	Sam Harris is an intellectual giant compared to Ben Shapiro. You need only watch Shapiros own show when he had Harris as a guest to see this.
Irrelevant Authority	He has more experience than you or I and 99% of the special minded folks here. We're all armchair analysts here and I'd take a former elite MMA fighters opinion much more than I'd take any of our idiotic opinions.
Irrelevant Authority	For the newer players who aren't aware: this is a former World Champion saying this, his words have weight.
Irrelevant Authority	On a real note, I hate people who won't listen to others because of their credentials, education, etc. It's such an awful personality trait. 10/10 meme thank u
Irrelevant Authority	Do you think you know more than 2 Stanford doctors?
Irrelevant Authority	Yeah, this doctor is a moron. Not smart like you.
Irrelevant Authority	&gt; To be fair it isn't China that's crippling America  You're right, its the trump administration that crippled america by A) disbanding our pandemic task force, and B) ignoring the information they had on the pandemic in **november**.  &gt; when far less extreme measures most likely would suffice.  So you know better than every medical expert that has talked openly about this topic?
Irrelevant Authority	Ultimately, upset fans will eventually have to come to terms with the fact that this is Star Trek, and the very heroes they look up to are telling them that. And they need to look long and hard about what Star Trek is and is about and if they as fans have been true to that.
Irrelevant Authority	I would imagine, from the decades of study and peer reviewed literature he has published over the years earning him the title of Dr and subsequently Professor. Kinda trumps high school and Wikipedia.
Irrelevant Authority	I've a degree in psychology. I know what the actual textbook definition of narcissist is. You're the troll. Look at your fucking handle.
Irrelevant Authority	Im not saying youre wrong but David Sinclair takes D with K. Am I to trust him or a random redditor?
Irrelevant Authority	> There is no good reason to take stories/accounts of miracles seriously  I propose that for a modern account of a miracle, if the person telling you the account is trustworthy, that is a reason to take the account seriously.
Irrelevant Authority	I was made aware by another user that most scientists agree that life begins at conception: https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3211703  I'll be editing my original post shortly.
Irrelevant Authority	Person here who has done a degree in psychology, from my personal perspective; IQ does not measure intelligence it simply gives us an insight into ones ability to take a test and memorise sequences etc. Theres massive flaws in the IQ test thats highlighted by language and cultural barriers.
Irrelevant Authority	"Reading a CIA experiment can't be seen has a waste of time. It's literally the ""intelligence"" agency. If they are looking at it and have been for a very long time. There has to be something to it. I've read almost every document, really informative stuff."
Irrelevant Authority	You aren't an epidemiologist, we can be pretty sure of that - so your speculations can and should be ignored.
Irrelevant Authority	Im still really aggravated by Elon Musks stupidity in tweeting about the panic of the virus being dumb, people are going to have read that and completely thrown care to the wind regarding the virus because he is viewed so highly. Is it still dumb with the incredibly speedy rise of infections in the US and Europe Elon? Or was that the fear of losing profit or having to close down production speaking before your brain.
Irrelevant Authority	Just so you know Im not going to read that because 1.) Im on the debate and political history team 2.) thats too much.
Irrelevant Authority	Older people have more life experience and wisdom and are generally able to make better decisions than 18 year olds. This disdain for the elderly is actually quite disgusting.
Irrelevant Authority	"Don't get the price hike is bearish argument. Why would they be raising prices if growth was sluggish? Also, if the goal were to pad weak earnings why would they need to preannounce? Why not just announce the price hike on the call? I think the two things are completely independent. I seriously doubt Reed Hastings went over their numbers for the quarter and said ""OH SHIT! QUICK- RAISE THE PRICES SO WE DON'T HAVE A QUARTERLY SELLOFF!!!!"" That's just not how these companies operate, quarter to quarter. If they are raising prices it's because they have data that shows customers don't care and it's good for their long-term prospects. It's just like the people arguing they were dumb to pay $100 million to renew friends. The people leading this company are not morons. They are data-driven and if they made these decisions it's because they have good reason to."
Irrelevant Authority	"yeah, don't get your hopes up that the CEO of one of the major social media outlets, as well as one of the easiest digital payment systems available for fiat, who's also heavily invested in mechanisms to increase blockchain usability, has publicly claimed that digital currencies stemming from blockchain are the future.  Everything you're saying is WHY people should ""get their hopes up."" A major player in the space is publicly endorsing it, and they have the power and potential to flip a few switches and suddenly embed Twitter + Cash + Square with lightning.    But no, we should listen to anonymous ""redditor for 2 days"" shitposters instead for our signals.  herrrrp deeeerrrrpppp"
Irrelevant Authority	"Thomas Aquinas is one of the most respected philosophers of all time... it's rather absurd to claim that you can refute his work with an elementary objection.  >IE ""All things require a cause external to themselves, but the first thing would need an external cause that had no external cause. We don't know any alternative to this, (and when you present one we'll simply assert it's impossible without evidence), and we don't know what it could be, therefore God exists.""  This is a horrible mangling of Aquinas's arguments, or any theological arguments. Did you get this from reading atheist websites or books?  No cosmological argument says ""everything needs a cause,"" those are the only places you can find that strawman. If you want to know what Aquinas or other philosophers say, read their work instead of how other atheists strawman them."
Irrelevant Authority	I find it funny how often the GOP, the self proclaimed champion of business, dismisses the opinions of Warren Buffet...a man who is the actual, no shit businessman that Donald Trump has always pretended to be.
Irrelevant Authority	Random customer telling multi billion dollar company of 50 years how to run there own business.   Lol
Irrelevant Authority	>Seems extremely unlikely that there would be such an immediate change.  You have a medical degree or just using your feelz?
Irrelevant Authority	Yes, the psychologists and doctors far smarter than you agree that it would be child abuse to force a child into a gender role that is not their own. That's why they gave their approval to this and recommend it. Good catch!
Irrelevant Authority	Teams in F1, F2, FE, Indy and WRC seem to think hes alright enough to hire him. But what do they know
Irrelevant Authority	Sorry to break it to her. The CDC, The National Cancer Institute, and The American Cancer Society say otherwise. Maybe she should have read the article. 
Irrelevant Authority	I am both a goalie and a USA hockey certified referee. If a goalie takes a slap shot in or near the head and goes down, you call the play dead IMMEDIATELY. What the referees did was extremely irresponsible and affected the outcome of the game.  They should be ashamed of themselves.
Irrelevant Authority	Reads like dis-info. Lot of research since to strongly suggest Shakespeare wasn't the real author. Nathaniel Hawthorne, Walt Whitman, and Mark Twain were Anti-Stratfordians, if that's the kind of evidence you're into. The only evidence that it was William Shakespeare is overshadowed by the evidence that he was just a pen name for others. Joe Atwill makes a case that it a woman. I like Bacon and de Vere. But it's a certainty that if you think it was William from Stratford then you haven't done any research on it at all.
Irrelevant Authority	Global warming set the stage for the new leftists strategy. It's settled science. The debate is over. It's consensus among the experts. We must do as they say or you're evil.
Irrelevant Authority	You shouldn't. All my decks are 100 - 107 card decks. Mostly just Vampire tribal. My current 107 card deck has taken me to platinum and I usually only play till my daily quests are done.
Irrelevant Authority	I'm simply advocating following the example of Jesus. Which is what being a Christian is all about, if I understand it correctly.
Irrelevant Authority	I think **QUINNIPIAC** knows more about polling than you do so settle down.
Irrelevant Authority	hm who would I trust? A Harvard professor that expertises in economics? Or an random redditor that knows just about zero in economics? I definitely wont choose the latter.
Irrelevant Authority	Nope. Olan is a professional. He knows what he is doing.
Irrelevant Authority	But that's literally what the expert economists suggest doing.    Regardless, all that getting rid of cap and trade did was introduce a more generic climate tax.  What would you suggest the way to fight climate change is?
Irrelevant Authority	Milton Friedman and Friedrich Hayek were both okay with wealth redistribution. You can redistribute wealth without restricting free markets.
Irrelevant Authority	Pex is used almost exclusively on This Old House builds.  I can't imagine that Rich Trethuey, a veteran plumber and host, or the producers of  TOH, or PBS who airs it would be comfortable advocating for unproven technology.  Copper is old technology, expensive materials, and expensive install.  What's not to love about PEX?
Irrelevant Authority	1. I'm a DM. 2. He specifically told me he put it on here to Taunt me. 3. I've already mentioned the thing with him vetoing any possible wish. 4. My character atleast has the right to try.
Irrelevant Authority	Understood, I would agree.  I'm posting it because it's from the BBC so I expect it to be well sourced by them.
Irrelevant Authority	My biology textbook (tenth grade) says that races for humans don't exist anymore, and I honestly don't think schools would teach blatantly wrong information just to appease to the current political or cultural climate. Science is still science.
Hasty Generalization	Hey that's great you managed to comically support people who assault or kill people who offend their religious views. 
Hasty Generalization	anti-abortion extremists don't really care about children.  Almost all of them have not adopted unwanted children and campaign to slash services for social programs.  Once you are born you are no longer a problem anti-abortion extremists care about.
Hasty Generalization	In the US Army, you have to run 2 miles in under 18 minutes. Anyone who has a pulse can do that. Anyone who is a high school athlete can absolutely do that.
Hasty Generalization	Just head over to /r/ProtectAndServe if you need any more confirmation that police departments are specifically recruiting psychopaths who think they have a license to kill anyone they want and get away with it.
Hasty Generalization	Donald Trump is a racist.  If you still support him at this point, I'm inclined to believe you are a racist.
Hasty Generalization	Druggies are gross. And apparently stupid. Why not profit from their chosen mental capacity? Bravo!
Hasty Generalization	My quick research shows 1 in every 2 Asians know tae kwon do.
Hasty Generalization	"For guys claiming to be 9""-10"", I am willing to suspend disbelief, because there are guys who are that big (Lex Steele, Mandingo, Tony Duncan).   However, being above 10"" is **uncharted** territory. I have yet to see a dick that big, IRL or in porn. "
Hasty Generalization	You know who this 61% of people are?  All of those people I remember from elementary school math class, bragging about how much they didn't need math.
Hasty Generalization	This reddit is just fucking stupid man. It's just a bunch of contradicting tweens that play off drama one way or the other.
Hasty Generalization	No doors, no locks, no walls, no borders. End racism and bigotry.
Hasty Generalization	Women are fine as acquaintances or coworkers, but when they become girlfriends they turn psycho. One girlfriend asked me a lot of questions about my previous relationships. She was always trying to figure out my feelings by examining how I describe my ex's.  Normal people ask you straight how you feel and take your response as the truth. But chics don't like doing things directly, for some psycho reason. I dated another woman who used this type of questioning to find ways to emotionally manipulate me. For example, if I did something for an ex, she would complain if I didn't do the same for her as a way to make me feel guilty.   
Hasty Generalization	"Yea....banks don't just ""make transactions vanish ""...plus you should monitor your account balances regularly.  I balance daily and it takes 5 minutes "
Hasty Generalization	> Hey! I did a quick google search and the cheapest neighborhood in SF for a 1 bedroom apartment is North Beach and it's averaging $2970.  This isn't true.  You can find plenty of 1 bd in SF for way cheaper than $2970.  I pay WAY less than this for a 2 bedroom with parking in the avenues.  Started lease this year.  Takes me 20-25 minutes to get to downtown using the bus.  
Hasty Generalization	While this did cross my mind I must say I disagree. Had I pitched on time there is a strong possibility that the yeast would have out competed whatever is in there now. My roommate and I have been brewing for over 2 years and have never had an infection so I would be surprised if it was infected due to poor sanitation practices. I assume this infection is something that floated in shortly after the wort had been cooled while it was being transferred to the carboy. 
Hasty Generalization	Fellow conservative, teaching children at a summer camp in SF (I come from NC) - the city is fine. Quit being such pussies and stop jumping to conclusions. Come out and form an original opinion, stop reading this bullshit.
Hasty Generalization	I think so. Every guy I met either hates cats, or heavily prefer dogs. Including me, who hates cats and heavily prefers dogs.
Hasty Generalization	I have a really nice pet chicken that loves to be pet so you are 100 percent wrong, turkeys are also very nice though.
Hasty Generalization	You're a prime example of why it wouldn't work. There's a stickied thread for suggestions and opinions on rules and you completely ignored it to make a new post rather than posting in the proper place. That's exactly what would happen with tech posts.  https://www.reddit.com/r/xboxone/comments/f8nfj2/state_of_the_subreddit_xbox_edition/
Hasty Generalization	So freaking true...I recently got a $100k+ job without a college degree, before my 30th birthday. I did it because I worked my ass off and learned a skill in the military. It's not that hard you just got to do the best you can.
Hasty Generalization	ACAB. Have policemen in the fam any time either have tried to bring something to the board or even just to other cops they get so much pushback theyve stopped saying anything. Id say theyre pretty shitty people for remaining in a profession they admit rewards (or at least protects) garbage behavior.
Hasty Generalization	So you're implying that the only reasons why white males succeeded was because of racism and sexism.. that's a very superficial outlook, and plays right into the hands of actual racists that would love to see white males suffer.
Hasty Generalization	PH redditors are bandwagoners. Accept the fact or you'll be downvoted with all their might. 
Hasty Generalization	I cant speak for TT, but whenever I've played digitally, if someone is knocked down via both down as opposed to a pow, they are twice as likely to be injured.
Hasty Generalization	There are people who cannot save with their meager salary and many necessities.   Yet I know some people who are earning minimum wage which to my surprise they opted to get plans with Iphones, have expensive tooth braces, etc.
Hasty Generalization	Thank you from all of us Trump supporters for continuing to prove our point about how psychotic you people are.   I look forward to another 4 years. 
Hasty Generalization	any form of forced wage is irrational.
Hasty Generalization	"A ""lawyer"" will argue for a man who raped and then flayed his mother alive while he stood there and watched her die in agony.  It's a lawyer thing."
Hasty Generalization	Whoever wrote that article is wrong. I know some people who are well off. My husband and I were talking with them the other day and we actually did the math. The tax plan would hurt them, but help my husband and I. We're middle class.
Hasty Generalization	Having played both MUT and UUT I can say you're way off. I haven't spent on this mode and I have multiple champs. 
Hasty Generalization	Family witness: when Soviets invaded our country in 1940  it had western living standards, Russians robbed everyone and sent all farmers to do unpaid slave work in collective farms. 
Hasty Generalization	I have plenty of friends with thousands of hours on d1 and d2 and they are going to play division 2 and other games. I still play destiny 2 a good bit, pretty much only PvP though because the PvE is boring
Hasty Generalization	Its been there for 18yrs....
Hasty Generalization	Americans have a completely erroneous understanding of the term 'socialism'.  In the US apparently 'Socialism' is any time the government does something that the private sector could also do.  That's it, that's the whole definition.
Hasty Generalization	That would make sense if the people who were against abortion and teen pregnancy were okay with proper sex education and using tax dollars to provide contraceptives to youth.   Spoiler alert: they're not. 
Hasty Generalization	>Almost every girl does this regularly or have done it in the past  Bullshit. Of all the women I've ever dated at least once, maybe one in 30 has been that much of a dick.  Get out of here with your Incel bullshit.
Hasty Generalization	I still do not understand why people need to use support so often. from the sound of it it seems like it is a daily problem for some people. The one time I had to use steam support, I was gotten back to the same day and my problem was fixed, couldn't be happier.
Hasty Generalization	I've never met anyone who goes to the movies on Christmas Days of all days. No one I know. Everyone is at home and traveling. 
Hasty Generalization	My dentist doesn't even speak English. 
Hasty Generalization	Now let us look at Ghostbusters and how did that turn out?   
Black-and-White Fallacy	I agree with the first proposition but strongly disagree with the second one.   Imagine questing in Barrens and not being able to find a single Zhevra for 12 hours and finally after you find it, you kill it and it doesn't drop anything.
Black-and-White Fallacy	So since you cant do it legally its ok to do it illegally?
Black-and-White Fallacy	Imma deny the Holocaust because there's either two possibilities  1: All the Jews died   2: None of them did because they never existed or are grossly xenophobic  See, if some Jews died and they're sweet little chosen people, then where the fuck is my Anne Frank waifu?  We could make dradle beyblades and I'd go to the synagogue with her every Sunday or whatever they call Sunday. Probably something like A'CHHHHbergstein day of the Boku No Christ  I want my Anne Frank waifu  Until than Jews are a meme and fake news
Black-and-White Fallacy	How about the existence of life?  Start with The observable fact that life exists.   Now ask How did life come to exist?.    This can be answered by a dichotomy: Life came to exist due to a natural process or a supernatural process.   Theres your logically valid argument that God (ie a supernatural process) *may* exist.
Black-and-White Fallacy	&gt; The lost carbon storage could be as high as 41 megatons by 2030  or an entire years worth of passenger vehicle emissions in Canada.  So all of the damage he has found from this practice over the next 10-11 years **could** be 1/10 or 1/11th as bad as one years worth of **passenger** vehicles emissions.  What is his alternative to lumber? Or roads?
Black-and-White Fallacy	If you are outraged by this, stop eating meat and dairy. Otherwise you are a hypocrite.
Black-and-White Fallacy	Light pollution vs Crime prevention. Wanna see stars or get raped and robbed, take your pick. 
Black-and-White Fallacy	"So sick of people calling Trump vs Hillary a ""false dichotomy"". They're both dangerous to our nation in their own rights. Yes, Trump is a racist, xenophobic, misogynistic demagogue.  And Clinton is a manipulative, corrupt, war-mongering, self-serving authoritarian. Our country will suffer under either. "
Black-and-White Fallacy	Apparently we love leaks and leakers until they are bad for Trump. The fuckin irony.  
Black-and-White Fallacy	Because they are all about climate change when their countries are being overrun and their citizens are being blown up. Way to get your priorities in order... Smh.
Black-and-White Fallacy	Are you actually ignorant of the history or lying?
Black-and-White Fallacy	Would you rather be tortured and beat or just killed
Black-and-White Fallacy	i personally thought philosophy was about being either extremely horny or not horny, but not both.
Black-and-White Fallacy	"Nah, I think it was pretty well done. It makes half his supporters ask themselves ""do I really belong lumped in with these other hateful people?""  I mean, if I found that I was supporting a candidate that was the candidate of choice for hate groups I'd kind of have to ask myself why I was supporting them. Unless I was one of them. In which case I'd already have my mind made up."
Black-and-White Fallacy	Live Fast. DIE  - GG Allin.
Black-and-White Fallacy	And where will they keep all the horses?  Wait sorry got confused for a second, I thought this was about cars and wagon makers for a second, or GE and candle making. 
Black-and-White Fallacy	"The opposite of men's rights is women's rights, under the umbrella of human rights. There is no equivelant male supremacy group ideology to feminism. Wish we'd stop conflating the two. You know those people with the extreme views you say try to ""hijack"" feminism? Those are the people who try to demonize any sort of advocacy for the human rights of men. Why do you agree with those extreme feminists?"
Black-and-White Fallacy	"""Please, help me out here.""  The alternative is to give up. Is that an option?"
Black-and-White Fallacy	"Honestly, this means absolutely nothing.  QBs arent gonna come out and say ""Nah, I don't think I'm ready, I think I'd rather sit this one out guys, sorry""   Even if he's not going to play, he would likely say this.  With TB not having a bye, it would be kinda dumb to have Jameis play and risk further injury, I would just sit him this game and rest up for next week"
Black-and-White Fallacy	Depends how you look at it. Do you want freedom of speech or do you want to be able to penalise people who say things you don't like?  This goes two ways. This also means that you must be penalised if you say something others don't like.  In this case the implication is that he not be allowed to bless anyone at all.  If you lose freedom of speech in the position of Rabbi what other positions should lose such freedoms?
Black-and-White Fallacy	so i should just seethe and accumulate my anger until i accumulate psychological problems until i develop problems later in life.  sounds very peaceful.
Black-and-White Fallacy	And if Seth Rich didn't leak the DNC emails, then that means there was a Russian hack. A Russian hack means this entire Seth Rich narrative is fake, and the Russian connection isnt. That is why you guys and the Trump administration are so desperate. 
Black-and-White Fallacy	The US really can't win though. We don't intervene and we're heartless. We do intervene and we're terrorists. 
Black-and-White Fallacy	Then youll have to pay for everything you access online.
Black-and-White Fallacy	Here is a good measure of your partisanship:  If you believe the claims that this Russian was killed because of the dossier, but categorically reject the claims that Seth Rich was killed for leaking the DNC docs, you are a blind partisan.  If you believe the claims that Seth Rich was killed for leaking the DNC docs, but categorically reject the claims that this Russian was killed because of the dossier, you are a blind partisan.  In both cases we have claims without any evidence.  Both are possible, neither are proven.  If you are tilted by my comment, you are a blind partisan.    
Black-and-White Fallacy	> Remove incentives for single parenthood   When you say this do you refer to forced abortions or forced starvation of a child?
Black-and-White Fallacy	Don't you know, arresting a man for teaching his pug a nazi salute for humors sake and detaining a woman for interviewing someone who is right wing is far more important than fighting against those that are sexually exploiting children!
Black-and-White Fallacy	OP here :) I have slept with women (they all cheated on me)     So either:   \* Women will sleep with misogynists, or,   \* Not all people who subscribe to the blackpill are misogynistic.     Seeing as I've had a lot of female friends tell me I'm very sympathetic towards women's struggles in society, it seems maybe it's the former? 
Black-and-White Fallacy	Then they'd just do regular damage and nothing special like *all* other dinos, where does the challwnge and variety go if they just get rid of what they do? Lmao
Black-and-White Fallacy	Any animal agriculture is worse for the environment so it's not a way to solve any problems. It also makes zero sense to kill 10,000 camels when they are raising 26.6 million head of cattle that drink way more water and are the number one cause of global greenhouse gas emissions.
Black-and-White Fallacy	And all the blacksmiths that went out of business, too, because of those new fangled automatic foundries!  So many, good paying jobs; gone, just because we're spoiled!
Black-and-White Fallacy	You must still watch VHS's then.
Black-and-White Fallacy	> Not a fan of state enforced dress codes.  But you're a fan of religious community-enforced dress codes? 
Black-and-White Fallacy	Vote for whom? Democrat  President, house and Senate 09 through 11 and nothing was done except shitty corporate Obamacare. Stick to hockey and McKenzie bros! Haha I am being a smartass but people get deluded about current Democratic party. Corrupt as fuck if you have eyes in your head.
Black-and-White Fallacy	In communism, no medication is available regardless of how much money you don't have!
Black-and-White Fallacy	"Because the trade we make for no monthly fees is paying ""excessively"" for cosmetics.  On balance, it's a trade I'll take."
Black-and-White Fallacy	The way I see it, as much as I want legal marijuana and better healthcare - we've done without those things for over 200 years. We can wait a little longer. If we give up our right to bear arms, though, that shit is *never* coming back.  
Black-and-White Fallacy	Have you seen Hong Kong? That's what you get if you don't have zoning requirements 
Black-and-White Fallacy	LET'S JUST CONTINUE TO DO NOTHING, THAT WILL CERTAINLY FIX THE PROBLEM. ITS NOT LIKE STRICTER GUN CONTROL LAWS HAVE WORKED IN EVERY OTHER FIRST WORLD COUNTRY.  Fucking morons.
Black-and-White Fallacy	Wouldn't you rather believe in something (give it a shot at least) and be wrong than believe in nothing and be wrong (ending up in Hell)?
Black-and-White Fallacy	So if this is pushing a political agenda I guess opposing this political agenda means you want more pollution and environmental destruction?
Black-and-White Fallacy	I believe the data speak for themselves regarding the alleged profound negative impact of neonics. Since the data show no problem with honeybee populations that strongly suggests no issue.  Of course the counter will be that that somehow it is wild/native bees which are being affected. That seems unlikely because domestic bees are more likely to be around agriculture/neonics. However, wild/native bees are not livestock so it could be that beekeepers undo the damage but only to honey bees.   Nevertheless, the general rule with pesticides is that you literally have to choose your poison: no pesticides leads to mass human starvation and greater environmental impact so you want to choose the safest ones you can.  Which also explains the benefit of glyphosate.
Ad Populum	Alot of people disagree 
Ad Populum	I mean...the bible suggests stoning people to death and I think most people would agree that is actually evil...so?    This also suggests atheists are somehow inherently immoral, something that is plainly not true. If anything, the good deeds of non-believers are the purest type of deeds, as they are carried out with no thought to the salvation they could provide.
Ad Populum	The facts of life, its complexity beyond chance; the testimonies of a billion people through all ages, even me, highly educated, numbers oriented, skeptical (law educated). Studied and found that Christ makes sense.
Ad Populum	&gt;many people  Judging by the comments and votes, you guys are in the minority. Get over it. 
Ad Populum	That is just one person's opinion. My husband and I are 10 years apart and we have a better relationship than a lot of couples who are the same age.  People date at work allllll the time. It's not like you are even her boss! You'll want to make sure you really sure about her feelings though, and it would be even better if you spent some time getting to know each other as friends.   It has a lot to do with maturity too - if she is more mature for her age. There's a lot to consider because you wouldn't want to wind up with someone emotionally unstable, dramatic and immature *especially* if things don't work out.  
Ad Populum	The feeling you're experiencing is called cognitive dissonance.  Instead of rationalizing this by suddenly denouncing McGreal, just accept that you're wrong.  There are *many* articles, including ones linked in this article, that undeniably prove that Hamilton is a hotbed of fascism.
Ad Populum	one of those movies made over 1 billion.
Ad Populum	People all around are already using it my friend. You just dont know who they are.  The left would use those same words you uttered to take your guns and bibles. 
Ad Populum	If she didn't have those stupid and ugly tattoos she'd be perfect.   Queue the downvotes from the Reddit teenagers who inexplicably love all tattoos any girl has.

Ad Populum	Over-rated by many people who think it is one of if not the best wrestling matches of all time, or under-rated by you?  Occam's razor.

Ad Populum	But most humans say hes a good hero https://hero.fandom.com/wiki/God_(theology)
Ad Populum	Are you aware that everyone feels this way about every place in the world, even the places they live?  There is no support for majority rule anywhere.  Do you believe in majority rule? Or do you think your fellow citizens are not capable of making real decisions?  Majority rule has never existed anywhere because nobody wants it.
Ad Populum	&gt; Because it take months for them to see a doctor in their own country, so they are willing to cross the border and pay cash to see someone here.  Like there aren't 'busses' of people going to Mexico and to Switzerland to seek treatment.   &gt;Additionally, its very dishonest, as canada's total population is only 37 million, That is less than the population of California.  The whole developed western world has a population of over half a billion people if you don't include U.S., that's almost twice as many as America has, yet every single one of them offers state operated healthcare coverage.   &gt;Numbers Matter!!  The 'wealthiest nation on earth' can't afford what everybody else has had for decades?
Ad Populum	Ambassadorships are basically figurehead positions. They don't really do anything other than host parties and shake hands. Actual policy work is done by the State Dept staff.  All presidents end up appointing friends, family, and big donors to swanky ambassadorship positions. I do think it's sketchy, but it's nothing new.
Ad Populum	There is a lot of wisdom in stability and measured change.  For example, radicalism causes destability and suffering.  There is good reason why people grow out of idealism in favor of realism.
Ad Populum	majority of reddit users are from the US.
Ad Populum	This is the part that really pisses me off, to be honest. Every criticism of Israel's policy towards Palestine is greeted with ridiculous accusations of anti-semitism. When it's literally just you and one buddy-big country against the rest of the world, then maybe, just maybe you are in fact on the wrong fucking side of history.
Ad Populum	"I am positively astonished by the ignorance in many responses here. Good. Grief.  Global warming is real, ~~you don't get 90+% consensus globally among educated people especially when it goes against economic gain.~~ Edit: Fallacy conceded. Does anything think there is a large group of people that want global warming to be real in some sort of ""I hate the earth/I hate industry/I'm an unpleasant bastard"" way? Nobody wants this shit to happen. Denial serves absolutely NO ONE."
Ad Populum	But if 990 people out of 1000 support net neutrality shouldn't we have it?  Why the hell not?  
Ad Populum	He has more respect from his people in Tibet than European politicians do at home. Maybe you should consider the opinions of other people too instead of listening to the same old political hogwash European politicians blurt out.
Ad Populum	got an odd thought  I'm thinking that if ALL your opponents are giving you the same exact argument over and over to the point where they sound like they've got some sort of weird hive mind, well I'm thinking that, maybe, weird thought but maybe, just maybe, it may be time to go look and see if maybe what they're saying is proven, objective common knowledge, and that's why they're not being all creative and original  just a thought
Ad Populum	tell that to the 76 upvotes
Ad Populum	"Interesting, commenters there also agree that Peterson was basically obliterated by Benatar. This sub remains the only place where people act as if Peterson ""won"" this debate."

Ad Populum	alright im triggered  has this dumb fuck ever used mods before  the massive modding community is what make skyrim a great game, better than witcher 3 in many ways, its the reason why so many people still are playing the game to this day while witcher 3 only has like 20% of the players skyrim has and its 4 years younger  so fuck this dumb kid 
Ad Populum	I'm happy you like it, the thing is, you're a very, very small minority.  And it's not a lie, and I'm not a hater, just look how many people are playing on Steam... no more than 1300 on peaks, falling as low as 560... we're almost close to Spore. 
Ad Populum	Read my comment man i can already do it i just dont agree with it. Its not a newly discovered mechanic that has been possible since the beginning of the game like a half flip has. Its only been made possible due to the addition of new key bindings in the last patch. Also many people seem to agree with my opinion. This was just a discussion no need to get all annoyed as you dont agree with me hahahaha 
Ad Populum	She's praised pretty much universally so maybe you're wrong.
Ad Populum	How many subscribers this guy has on YouTube?  <crickets>
Ad Populum	What Zd_17 is trying to say is that average people live hard lives and the politicians live pleasurable and easy lives.   Though I think this message is self defeating, it is true. True all over the world. 
Ad Populum	You can overtake on right, but you should only if you need to and if youre being extra careful.  Calling op fucking idiot for something everyone does is just you being an asshole.
Ad Populum	Multiple people at the party also believed she was being racist lol
Ad Populum	At least four countries are partially or fully shut down.  Concern over this virus is not an overreaction for the most part.
Tradition Fallacy	Humans have consumed animals for as long as we have existed. This is a fact. The consumption of animals is not the issue, in my opinion. It is the industrialization of meat that is wrong and cruel. It is the fact that big industry cares more about money and mass production than the animals' lives.
Tradition Fallacy	A dog is a domesticated animal, which has been used for home protection and companionship for centuries. Pigs are food source animals and have been farmed and used as such for centuries as well. There is no comparison, they are two completely different situations.
Tradition Fallacy	Fuck that man it's the circle of life we're omnivores for a reason. we're natural meat eaters and have been for millennia.
Tradition Fallacy	Since the dawn of man we have had the death penalty. In reply to people who worry about the state deciding life and death, I agree is should be a local issue.  Even just 150 years ago, if you killed someone in a small community the local men would get together and go out to deal with you.  Killers can't be trusted to walk free.  They have violated someones NAP and will do it again.
Tradition Fallacy	Imaging thinking this is just cherry picking... literally everyone was racist in this time period... lmfao what fairy tale do you live in.
Tradition Fallacy	I may be downvoted for this, but the norm usually is that high-value women are sought after, they dont do the seeking out. It might come off as desperate. I have been approached by women before, and it was pleasant. We got to know each other a bit, and even hooked up a few times. However, if a woman approaches me first, I somehow dont view her as relationship material. It might be because I want to be the one to set up the tone in my initial interactions with a woman I want to be in a relationship with. Take my suggestion with a grain of salt, but also know that there are other men out there who feel the same. I want to court the woman, not have the woman court me. I want to propose to a woman, not have the woman propose to me.
Tradition Fallacy	How can you hate a profession that shaped the foundation of our species?
Tradition Fallacy	Because its a dietary staple that humans have relied on for thousands of years?   Excessive amounts of carbs are bad but you cant not eat carbs because muscle relies on them for energy.  Again, excessive amounts of carbs are bad, but its a highly efficient source of energy in the appropriate amount, like sugars.
Tradition Fallacy	It is. It has been for hundreds and thousands of years. Violence is often the answer. 
Tradition Fallacy	US was corrupt lonnnnnng before trump and will be long after he leaves.
Tradition Fallacy	I think the argument that we have been eating meat for thousands of years is not used enough. Eating meat is very much a culture thing that is engrained in us.
Tradition Fallacy	Just because they use tactics you disagree with doesn't mean they aren't protesters. Looting and destruction of police property have been protest tactics for decades.  https://www.theoxfordblue.co.uk/2020/06/02/why-looting-is-a-legitimate-form-of-protest/
Tradition Fallacy	people who get pissy about team orders must be recent fans because the history of F1 is jam-packed with team orders.  It's not fun to watch and it's not ideal, but they're fighting for championships.  Their job is to do everything they can to secure that championship.  People have lost championships at the end of the year because their team had decided earlier in the year *not* to give team orders.  It's just part of the game.
Tradition Fallacy	I'm vegan, I'll never part take in this activity, but I don't feel like hunting for fun should be considered a mental illness. Our ancestors used to depend on it to survive, so I can see how it might be in someone's genome to want to hunt. Hunting is almost entirely aligned with the natural cycle of life, factory farming in horrible conditions isn't. Downvotes incoming
Tradition Fallacy	Downvote this if you must, but tell me why people should disrupt the food chain? Humans have consumed animals for all of time
Tradition Fallacy	We've bred sheep for literally ten thousand years. Why would we stop now?
Tradition Fallacy	And if any other country was in America's position in the world for the last 7 decades, they would do the same kind of shit in order to conform the world into what they want it to be.  As all centers of power have done for the entire history of organized humanity.  Iran just can't project their desires on the same scale.  It's like hating rich people, but then playing the lottery in the hope you actually get a bunch of money.  Or working hard to just get a job that pays you 6 figures.  Congrats, you're now part of the 1%.  Or 10%, whatever let's you sleep at night, you greedy immoral fuckface.
Tradition Fallacy	You realize that killing things and eating them has been a staple of life since the dawn of time right?
Tradition Fallacy	Yeah, but I really don't care. It's not unethical, it's being human. You gonna walk up to a bear and tell him to only eat a plant-based diet?  Humans have been hunting animals for a while. We are animals, we are apart of the food chain. If you decide to only eat plants, go ahead. I'm not judging you but you gotta stop judging others
Tradition Fallacy	Im so shocked this is a thing were debating now. Why do so many people think youre an asshole for doing the thing weve all been doing for decades?
Tradition Fallacy	For 2000 years it has been a Jewish ritual and now it's mutilation of an infant. Norway can do what they want but it seems specifically anti-semitic. 
Tradition Fallacy	the relationship that leads to procreation needs to be unique. marriage has been that relationship consistently throughout history.  let's keep it that way.
Tradition Fallacy	There are several hundred years of scholarly material and Protestant tradition to give you a clue.
Tradition Fallacy	I'm Asatru because it is the closest thing we have to the ancient religion of my Ancestors, something that must never be forgotten or lost, and something that aligns with my morals and feels right.  That's all I really need to know.
Tradition Fallacy	True, but he probably saved a bunch of money and people have been administering circumcisions for years with tools far more primitive than a steak knife. They probably looked it up on the internet first. 
Tradition Fallacy	"I don't know, I'm pretty atheist and anti religion, but I think that we should respect other people's beliefs as long as they don't get in the way of our own well being, and since we're already treating most of the animals we eat like shit, I think it's pretty unfair and intolerant for the Danish government to specificaly forbid Kosher slaughtering.  Religion isn't only about ""believing in a fictional entity"". It's about culture, community, identity. There would be no society without religion, before states and laws and nations, it was the only thing that could help build a community. I believe that we as humans are able to grow out of it and build a society that doesn't need myths and rituals and stupid irrational rules, but as long as it is not the case I think religious people still deserve to be able to practice the basic rituals of their religion, as longs as it doesnt hurt anybody. And yes, I care about animals, but not this much."
Tradition Fallacy	Who the fuck cares?   Marriage has never ever been between two people of the same gender before, ever.
Tradition Fallacy	Mandatory, no.  But the first in 40 years to not release this information is somewhat....odd.
Tradition Fallacy	">does the author seriously expect a candidate to ""peacefully concede"" if a similar situation occurred  Absolutely. Al Gore peacefully conceded in 2000 after the supreme Court named named George W. Bush president even though he had won the popular vote.    John Kerry peacefully conceded even though there was clear evidence of election rigging in Ohio.    The losing candidate peacefully conceding is what has made our country stable for last 240 years. "
Tradition Fallacy	Chicken is good. Its food. So is meat. How do people think the native americans and humankind has been eating for a million years? Meat. 
Tradition Fallacy	The 1950's nuclear family thing I agree with. The whole idea of getting married (or some sort of family union) and having children has been around since human society began, so not sure how stupid it is.
Tradition Fallacy	I wonder what people did before smartphones and GPS. Oh that's right they paid the fuck attention where they were going and followed signs on the road or trail.  I swear technology makes most people even more retarded.
Tradition Fallacy	Because the person who told me was trying to convince me that its an accepted military tactic. Ive now learned that its illegal according to the Geneva convention (and most nations) but it is so incredibly widespread and common that its just a fact of war.
Tradition Fallacy	And joined the 36 billion women who have given birth this way since time began.  What if I told you that you don't need a hospital room.
Tradition Fallacy	I'm an avid vape user these days, free of tobacco since September.  I don't understand the big deal in going outside to smoke, we couldn't smoke inside before so whats the big deal now?  Hell unless I'm at home I will go outside to vape anyways because its part of my routine, and I enjoy being able to still socialize over a smoke while maintaining my decision to be healthier.   Get over it and go outside.
Tradition Fallacy	>I suppose I would then be opposed to allowing heterosexual marriage if it was found to be more harmful than allowing no one to be married.  I understand, but thousands of years of heterosexual marriage doesn't seem to have caused any harms.  I would argue that it has stood the test of time to avoid such scrutiny.
Tradition Fallacy	The instinctive caring (female) mother and bread winning (male) father. This has been a family value for many centuries. 
Tradition Fallacy	"So I'm from a Jewish family but I consider my self atheist and I know that if I have a boy and don't circumcise him, my dad will be so offended by it.    My reason for it is it's cruel to put a baby through it, he should get a choice in what happens to his man parts, it makes it less sensitive which seems mean, I don't beleieve in religion and cutting my baby's dick isn't just 'one of those things' to just do to save agro from my dad.    His reasons are that if it's not done the baby isn't considered Jewish, he can't be buried in a Jewish cemetary, it's a given that all Jewish boys are circumcised.    There is no reasoning with my dad though.  He won't listen to my points because the ""Jewish tradition dates back and has been done for generations"" yada yada. It'll just have to be a lot of aggro at the time.  "
Tradition Fallacy	What you are is wrong because you do not fit the traditional, normal way all humans should be. If you disagree, there are so many other places, and subreddits you can go to validate your mentally ill world view. 
Tradition Fallacy	First of all, owls are birds of prey. Not killing predators is a fundamental part of wildlife conservation. Dogs and cats were socially domesticated by humans thousands of years ago, and again both are predators. Pigs, cows and chickens however, are only domesticated in the sense that didn't want to have to hunt them and they aren't predators. **TL;DR** Because, at least for our culture, its been that way for thousands of years.
Tradition Fallacy	"I posted this before and I don't think many people saw it before so I'll post again.    Let's not pretend that the currency never had any religious phrases before 1956. ""Annuit cptis"" above the pyramid on the great seal means ""He (God) approves of the undertakings"". It was also originally designed in 1782 by the founding fathers. Sorry this is a fight that just isn't worth fighting."
Tradition Fallacy	Animal consumption is a matter of human survival. It has helped humans survive since the dawn of our time. Having sex with an animal is not, making it much harder to explain away as a society. That's the anthropological way of looking at it.   From a zoological perspective, animals also hunt/scavenge and kill other animal species for food, but by and large do not attempt to mate with them (with the exception of closely related species). Horses don't mate with kangaroos. So, we are following the behavior of other animal species.
Naturalistic Fallacy	Isn't that the video of grinding up male chicks?  That happens because males don't have the same muscle structure and have worse tasting meats.  But, you know, animals eat animals all the time. I still eat meat even when people like this show me stuff.  I mean, knee surgery is gross to me, but it has a purpose.
Naturalistic Fallacy	Hey: Im not trying to be edgy. Im trying to show them that theyre being ridiculous by doing things like making others feel bad for following natures rules. You can be a vegan, I dont have a problem with it, but on the subreddit they constantly post stuff degrading people who follow natures way. Its ok to be vegan, but they have done things such as putting cards on packs of steak trying to make people feel bad about doing what is human nature.
Naturalistic Fallacy	Meat is not disappearing any time soon. I sacrifice animals I love every year. Even if I could raise animals with no brain or pain, I wouldnt. The way we slaughter them at small scale on our property is humane and quick, they feel less suffering than they would on any other given day.   They dont live out their lifes in pens or go to a slaughter house. Theyre probably happier than most of your domestic pets.  Life eats life. I really dont give a single fuck if it outrages or upsets you weakling vegan city dwellers. Youve had no real struggle in your life, thats why youre in a position to whine about such things. Youre all so far removed from nature you cant tell your head from your ass anymore.
Naturalistic Fallacy	anyone that disagrees with this is ignoring nature...  With that said, our current manner of factory-farming, confining animals to small enclosures so they can't exercise and have nothing to do but eat, and pumping them full of antibiotics to combat the resulting health effects is nothing short of a disaster that tortures animals, rapidly evolves antibiotic-resistant bacteria, and leaves us with a worse meat product.  It's like climate change.  Yes, the way we're doing things directly impacts our long-term survival, but how can we worry about that when there's so much steak to eat and stuff to watch on TV??
Naturalistic Fallacy	High carb diets are not sufficient for me in many ways. Whole grains like whole wheat products destroy me. I will never believe in a diet that contradicts how we evolved.
Naturalistic Fallacy	I know, PETA, extremist Vegans, etc, just can't accept this is part of the cycle of life.  Cows eat grass, we eat them. There's literally nothing wrong with it
Naturalistic Fallacy	You're damned right.  We need to arrest and incarcerate every cat that kills a mouse, and every bird that eats an insect.
Naturalistic Fallacy	Its worse because its not even instinct for all animals to respond this way. There are numerous bird species that pair off for life, and other animals have shown the capability to bond with a specific partner or companion.   Like if a goose can have a monogamous relationship with another goose, whats wrong with you?
Naturalistic Fallacy	So for years while we were not evolving to eat veggies, one would think we would have suffered from massive vitamin deficiencies. Yet, somehow we made it to where we are today. Veggies that are not even 300 years old must be the best thing we can eat. I doubt it.
Naturalistic Fallacy	Killing Animals is fine as long as that Animal doesn't die in vain. People that hunt just to mount it's head on a Wall or just so they can get a picture next to the poor dead animal are Evil in my opinion. Killing for Food is Nature.
Naturalistic Fallacy	"She wants a ""society, built on cooperation instead of individualism, on mutual aid instead of self-preservation."" Lady, have you ever heard of a thing called human nature? How are you going to convince Chicagoans to cooperate with each other when every weekend in Chicago is a massacre? If you can't do it in Chicago, how could you do it anywhere else? Sit down."
Naturalistic Fallacy	You may check out Social Darwinism. That may help a lot.
Naturalistic Fallacy	We are omnivores. Eating meat is in people's nature. Being intolerant of people's nature is the same thing mindset that causes homophobia and racism.
Naturalistic Fallacy	What does 'natural' mean? Anything appearing in nature is natural. Therefore homosexuality is natural.
Naturalistic Fallacy	1. Animals, like us, are living beings. Although theyre being raised with the sole purpose of being killed, it should at least have a healthy life and painless death beforehand. Theyre living, too. They deserve to be treated with compassion.  2. We need protein, and one way to obtain that is through meat consumption! (I know I already said that in my post). Eating meat and killing fellow living beings for survival is natural. If we use animals to obtain that, its not inherently bad, as long as theyre treated benevolently.
Naturalistic Fallacy	"I feel like this is being pedantic.  I mean theres an obvious difference between the chemicals in a potato versus something like Splenda where the ""how its made"" is:  &gt;*SPLENDA is also the brand name for the ingredient sucralose.  It is made through a patented, multi-step process that starts with  sugar and converts it to a no calorie, non-carbohydrate sweetener. The  process selectively replaces three hydrogen-oxygen groups on the sugar  molecule with three chlorine atoms.*  I eat it all the time, but I'm not about to look down on someone for not consuming something so unnatural.  I feel like there is still a lot of unknowns when it comes to gut bio as well."
Naturalistic Fallacy	Most values can be answered by science with evidence, if it's just about policy. An individual might oppose Homosexuality, but there is proof showing that it is natural, for example.
Naturalistic Fallacy	Uh, we have canine teeth
Naturalistic Fallacy	Bullying is part of nature, suck it up.
Naturalistic Fallacy	This is definitely one of the upsides to being vegan. The paranoia of under-cooking and worry of overcooking is reduced by (I'd say) 90%. Plus a lot of vegan ingredients can be eaten raw in some form (obviously check first!). That's always a good discussion to have with meat eaters:  If were meant to be eating it, why can't we catch it with our bare hands and eat it raw? We're genetically constructed to be herbivores, therefore meat will make you ill.  EDIT: I am mistaken to say we're genetically made to be herbivores. We can deal an omnivorous diet to some extent. However, the point I'm making is that we cannot go out and hunt a [insert animal here], kill and eat it without using something we are not naturally equipped with.
Naturalistic Fallacy	Money is just a technology.   Greed is a defect of human nature.  You cannot regulate away original sin.
Naturalistic Fallacy	> laws against theft, murder, slavery,   Good people don't need laws to tell them how to be good, bad people either ignore laws or use/create them to hide behind...
Naturalistic Fallacy	We are not the only species that does it though, Orcas play fetch with living seals for example, and they are among the smartest animals.
Naturalistic Fallacy	>Why **is** or isn't the fetus a person?  Because there's no rational distinction between the unborn and the born that can be consistently applied if we want to keep our general morality intact. i.e it undermines the suppositions that makes the rest of our moral language comprehensible regarding human worth being absolute and inviolable, all humans being equal in dignity and so forth.   >Why **does** or doesn't the fetus's life supersede the mother's suffering in pregnancy & childbirth?  Because pregnancy is a natural part of life and parents have a moral obligation to see to the well-being of their children.
Naturalistic Fallacy	Yes, because nature [is so sweet and kind](https://www.reddit.com/r/natureismetal/comments/c110qh/seagull_eating_pigeon_while_still_alive/).
Naturalistic Fallacy	Abortions have been a thing since the beginning of human history. There is no stripping the unborn of societal ammenities by saying they are not persons because it has always been like that. Black people weren't slaves from the outset of human history. This was an evolved understanding. No understanding of unborn livelihood has evolved.
Naturalistic Fallacy	There is no species in nature that practises monogamy. It is an artificial construct.
Naturalistic Fallacy	carnists holy shit those people are toxic. i understand theres awful cruelty in big businesses, but if you buy meat from select farms that you know treat the animals well and respectfully, then i think its fine. humans are meant to eat meat, just as all carnivores and omnivores. thats how we work, if someone doesnt want to eat meat then okay, but its a natural right lol. shouldnt rag on others
Naturalistic Fallacy	Sadly most buyers are unaware of the ingredients in so called fake meat. It contains stuff no parent would feed their child like genetically engineered hemoglobin made from yeast to be as close to blood as possible without actually being blood. The stuff is such garbage that the [CEO of whole foods condemned it.](https://www.dailywire.com/news/whole-foods-ceo-says-plant-based-fake-meat-bad-ashe-schow). Articles like this distract people from the real issue which is health and safety,  not innovation. Oreos and Cheese Whiz were innovations. Real food pretty much stays the same.
Naturalistic Fallacy	That is a bad argument, all drugs can be harmful. But I think we can both agree that synthetic drugs are more harmful. For example synthetic weed can kill people while normal weed cannot.
Naturalistic Fallacy	Mate since the beginning of our species we where designed to hunt right? Evolution made us omnivorous, so we could adapt and be more versatile, our teeth are good for eating steak in general. And no, I dont kill animals for funsies, I enjoy eating meat and I wouldn't kill them for fun
Naturalistic Fallacy	smoking cigs is possibly the worst thing you could be doing... there is tar in weed smoke but ZERO chemicals and poisons, which is all you get in cigs. quit the cigs while you can. stick to just buds. and you sound young, you shouldn't be smoking cigarettes anyway, quit while youre still young. 
Naturalistic Fallacy	Cause drugs can have bad effects on the baby. Why not go drug free and how nature intended? Not to mention also all of the terrible things that can happen if something goes wrong administering an epidural.  Edit: I don't mean to offend people of course, but I think me saying Why can't a person go drug free that's how nature is, doesn't make me a bad person. They can choose whatever they want obviously. But it helps me thinking this is how nature intended to try to deal with the pain. I'm not even against an epidural if I feel the mom needs it. I just don't understand why someone was questioning a mom to go drug free if she wanted to do natural.
Naturalistic Fallacy	Err... people have been butchering and eating animals they know for ten thousand years. Veganism is an urban phenomenon.
Naturalistic Fallacy	Nature is pretty cruel. I dunno what he thinks happens when people aren't in the picture.  ITT: people who can't address what I actually wrote so imagine I said something else that's easier to argue. Good job vegans.
Naturalistic Fallacy	Do cumbrains not realize that's totally unhealthy? The reason you feel that way is because it's not natural or healthy to masturbate. You don't feel that way at all after sex
Naturalistic Fallacy	Most animals eat other animals.  Lol
Naturalistic Fallacy	It's delicious. It keeps my body healthy. I'm an omnivore. Try and ask the Lions to eat a salad instead of an antelope
Naturalistic Fallacy	For a communist system to work in any sense at all it literally has to micromanage everyones lifes through force because forms of classes is nature and nature literally always prevails
Naturalistic Fallacy	Some animals eat other animals. That is how nature works. We are one of them. We NEED meat and dairy. You can find alternatives but can't replace them. Refusing to eat meat is against nature.
Naturalistic Fallacy	You cant stop nature. Youre going to be infected if you havent already. We are always trying to fight nature. We just have to let it run its course.
Naturalistic Fallacy	"Uhhhh. Literally the ENTIRE universe of league revolves around magic. It is pretty much the very fabric of the world. If anything you are just reinforcing how big of a blight Demacia's rules are in that world. ""HUR MAGIC BAD HUR"".   I mean seriously. Literally every other nation, race, and place is tied into magic in some shape or form. To say that magic is wrong IS wrong, because magic is the natural state of things. To side with other comments, you're one of those Demacian bootlickers. "
Worse Problem Fallacy	I mean, there are plenty of annoying gamers on youtube no matter what gender.
Worse Problem Fallacy	My neighbors have chickens which attracts mice because they throw chicken feed all over their yard. I live in a suburb of Las Vegas, the Lots in my neighborhood are a quarter acre. My cats are indoor outdoor, they totally murder all the mice that attempt to damage my house. They also kill the ginormous cockroaches. I've only ever seen them take shits in my yard and not other people's yards. My neighborhood is full of gangs and I've heard people get murdered and attacked with my very own ears, I'm pretty sure my cats aren't the ones destroying my neighborhood or the environment
Worse Problem Fallacy	I don't support everything that has ever been done by anyone claiming to be under the flag of antifa.  I also get incredibly suspicious when someone, or some group, spends an inordinate amount of time talking shit about antifa because that tends to correlate with some pro-fascist, or at least pro-alt-right sentiments.  Normal people don't have strong opinions about antifa because antifa isn't terribly destructive in the grand scheme of things
Worse Problem Fallacy	Despite losing over half of his body and his independence, it's awe inspiring to see he hasn't lost the will to live. It's very impressive, it makes me feel foolish. If this man can keep a smile on his face there's no reason why I can't.
Worse Problem Fallacy	and still they are living better than rest of the world.  America... stop being pathetic
Worse Problem Fallacy	Republicans - another problem is worse so lets ignore this problem
Worse Problem Fallacy	Be kind, stop worrying, focus on what makes you smile, take every hinderance as something positive as everything can always be worse. Ex: I stubbed my toe! Sure it hurts, but its not broken. If its broken, well atleast i dont have to cut it off. There is always a bigger picture. Also it takes so much energy being angry and worried. You cant change everything. But that doesnt mean you have to settle for something bad. You always have a choice. I mean there is a trillion different things to do to help your mental well being. Say no to stuff, say yes sometimes to stuff. Depends on the situation and who you are as a person.
Worse Problem Fallacy	Alcohol is the least of our problems.

Worse Problem Fallacy	I come from a Hasidic Jewish background, and they care about the socks just as much. doesnt help the gays any, might as well just be happy the christians arent protesting the socks
Worse Problem Fallacy	"You will be tested on specific-generalities (polar opposites). Your exams will have ""correct"" answers that directly contradict your 500$ textbooks. Your exams will be written in with passive vocabulary. Many nurses/instructors/student LACK empathy. For example students will cry and complain about working while going ro school. These students dont empathize that their instructors are commuting hundreds of miles/week between campuses, classes, faculty meetings, labs etc. My experience so far has been bs. 4.0 student though. Good luck. Oh again nursing exams are opinion based dogshit..."
Worse Problem Fallacy	Why does the world seem so against white hate groups?  The organized religions are hate groups and accepted. They are considered moral while most of them also preach hate to some degree, based on a fictional novel. They create hate of other faiths, and have killed way more that racist groups have.
Worse Problem Fallacy	The fact that the poor have phones and refrigerators is evidence to support the rising tide metaphor. Theres plenty of places with worse economy where the poor do not have phones. The fact that our poor do have phones indicates a generally higher quality of living than places without them.
Worse Problem Fallacy	Of all the sackless, ineffectual, pathetic things you could do in the world - whining on a barely read subreddit from an anonymous throwaway account is the most.  There are people being used as a meat puppet by their burly prison cell-mate who are less btchmade than this post.
Worse Problem Fallacy	YoUrE NoT AlLoWeD To CaRe AbOuT tHiS bEcAuSe ThAt iS mOrE iMpOrTaNt  Well there is climate change, war, world hunger, incurable diseases, and violent tragedies why are you not spending every second of your day complaining about them and why are you not spending every cent you have on helping stop them you worthless human being? 
Worse Problem Fallacy	I don't get how American feminists fight for the use of gender neutral language and such (like in my university) when issues like this exist? I want to do everything in my power to help Bangladeshi women not have to deal with this
Worse Problem Fallacy	Its kinda fucked up if that you want to dump your bio mom because you want a perfect box while others want to meet theirs and cry for it.
Worse Problem Fallacy	Someone will always have it worse than you
Worse Problem Fallacy	He didn't even kill anyone. He bombed some facilities where they did chemical testing on animals. That's it.  A lot of smart people do extreme stuff, because when you take moral principles and actually apply them, you get very radical answers.
Worse Problem Fallacy	1st world problems
Worse Problem Fallacy	Damn, you'd think feminists would have bigger and better things to worry about apart from candy.
Worse Problem Fallacy	This is a bogus publicity stunt and an insult to homeless people who are REALLY struggling. The Valley is a hotbed for anyone who's even looked at python or java -- absolute dumbasses are being given jobs in the close-to-six-figure range. All he had to do was apply through a public library computer and he would've had 10 offers. What a joke, and an embarrassment.  
Worse Problem Fallacy	Lemme make it simple here. An individual black persons racism is far less of a problem from the western context because we are dramatically less likely to hold any position of power where that prejudice will ever matter. We are underrepresented in the financial, educational, scientific, vocational, and political sectors so we have much less opportunity to make our racism a reality.   Beyond this, even if half of all black people in America were racist it would still be only 20.5 million racists. If half of all white people were racist (see Donald Trumps share of the 2016 vote) that would mean there's 100 million racists.  Which number sounds like more of a problem?
Worse Problem Fallacy	Americans, take note. You think Trump is a fascist? Trump isn't anywhere near the vociferous vitriol spewed by JB. Not that I'm happy for Brazil in this moment, but I am glad the US will have a true fascist to compare its president to, and maybe it will give the Left some pause over the accusations they've made against the POTUS.
Worse Problem Fallacy	There are real, actual problems in the world that deserve attention and scrutiny. Many of them involve police officers.  This is not one of those problems.
Worse Problem Fallacy	"You want to see real patriarchy? This is real patriarchy, where men can just indiscriminately kill women based on nothing more than rumors.  Think about this next time you think about complaining about ""microagressions""."
Worse Problem Fallacy	If you believe the deck is stacked against you, youll never get anywhere in life.   Its getting a little tiresome hearing how hard young people have it today. Yeah, its harder than 20, 30, or 40 years ago but damn, try growing up in the 1930s right after the Great Depression.  Or how about the 1850s, or how about any other time in HUMAN HISTORY.  Complaining about how hard things are now is like listening to a millionaire complain they dont have a private jet.  I suppose most of it is just coming from the vocal minority of those with a victim mentality but damn, its getting old.
Worse Problem Fallacy	Of all the problems in the world and in addition to the ones you're going through this is what you focus your attention on?
Worse Problem Fallacy	Imagine going to white people therapy because your feelings are hurt when motherfuckers are dying from lack of access to clean water.  Fuck yall sensitive first world problems
Worse Problem Fallacy	"This really strikes home for me how horrific it is to live in China.    Every redditor that clicks on this, or likes or or comments on it, is safe only because they dont live in China.   If you were one of the 1 in 5 people on earth who live in China, an image such as this could be the difference between you being free, or being one of the 4.75 million people they imprison in re-education camps, labour camps  and just ""administrative detention.""  And we the world just watch.  And talk about baby trump balloons"
Worse Problem Fallacy	The status quo in America is that its the best its ever been. We live in one of the best societies in the best times that humans have ever experienced.
Worse Problem Fallacy	I was pointing out what real oppression looks like to those people (many on Reddit) who like to claim they are oppressed in western society, by made-up bogeymen like the patriarchy and privilege.   Care to explain your comment? 
Worse Problem Fallacy	People are litterally walking around starving, freezing, living in shitty places where landlords refuse to fix.    The teachers and union can complain all they want, and they have been for a very long time, but that time is past.  We make cuts now, even if they scream bloody murder about it.  If they would have just been reasonable and embraced technology decades ago this wouldn't have been nearly as big an issue.
Worse Problem Fallacy	flint still doesnt have clean water btw. puerto rico still doesnt have power.
Worse Problem Fallacy	Really puts the pathetic shit people protest about in Canada and the States in perspective.  Just goes to show you can have all the freedom and opportunity in the world but people will always find something to bitch about it. The sad thing is people find MORE to complain about in places like North America because they have all the time in the world to sit around and dream up shit that offends or upsets them.   Meanwhile on the rest of the planet people are having their eyes gouged out just because they want safe roads or are being jailed for life for not wearing a Burqa.
Worse Problem Fallacy	I'd love to see these middle class 'feminists' go to places like Saudi Arabia and Iran so they could see for themselves just what gender based violence really looks like.
Worse Problem Fallacy	Young adults in France are [getting their hands blown off](https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/7936392/french-yellow-vest-protester-has-hand-blown-off-by-grenade-as-france-descends-into-violence-and-bloodshed/) and [their eyes shot out](https://www.rt.com/news/446389-france-police-target-civilians/) from their protests all the while our young adults rally and lobby for word policing. They don't understand that the bubble you are creating is NOT helpful for your professional career and outside of it you will find communities, careers, and people who do not have the patience that this school has. The school here is fostering a dangerous precedent allowing students to make the calls they are now. Does no one remember Evergreen State University? Or how about Missou?  Yes, I understand that the suspect was in fact NOT transgender.  Let's just have sometime to contemplate what it all means.  P.S Only ~5 Months until I graduate and leave this place.
Worse Problem Fallacy	I guess this is more important than the third worlders we have living in hotels on our dollar. 
Worse Problem Fallacy	This is so stupid. The hallmark ID for an NBA youngblood is their incessant complaining about the refs. NBA refs are already the best among any basketball league in the world. Watch college, euro, or Chinese basketball sometime. Your ass will come crawling back with tear stained diapers, grateful for the refs we got. The NBA officials are fine. If folks think they can do better, they should pick up a whistle and try to zebra a rec league.

Worse Problem Fallacy	\> inb4 'America is just as bad fucking Drumpf trade wars are easy to win hurr durr'   Every last hysterical liberal in the US who keeps calling Trump fascist or a dictator or whatever needs to slap themselves across the face and think really hard about why the trade imbalance is what it is and the total vulnerability of our economy where all productive capacity is controlled by China.
No Fallacy	This is actually a problem for trans folks. If youre a trans kid pre puberty, it is often a valid option to take puberty blockers. The idea is that you can wait to actually go on HRT until youre an adult and can be sure youre trans. If youre not, you just stop taking the blockers and go through puberty. If you are, it makes HRT a lot more effective.  Obviously this isnt allowed in all cases, and psychiatric approval is required, but having transphobic parents that dont allow you to start taking puberty blockers can be really damaging. I know the whole making me go through puberty without my consent thing sounds ridiculous, but its actually a real issue.
No Fallacy	This is a very slippery slope. What's next to be banned badthink? And who's deciding?  Facebook and Twitter already help China keep the outside world away and its dangerous opinions from its citizens, maybe Youtube is jealous.
No Fallacy	Me persoanlly? I'm a big believer in freedom. Close schools, close stores, close places people congregate. Tell someone who they can't associate with? That's not what the Constitution says.  Don't get me wrong. I'm not suggesting everyone should go about as if this isn't serious. I'm saying educate people and they will make correct decisions.
No Fallacy	Can someone make r/popularmisconception ? I feel like half the posts on here lately have been technicalities rather than truly widely unknown, unaccepted or counter-intuitive facts.

No Fallacy	That shouldn't be a fucking Mogstation mount. Should be from the damn Hatching Tide event.
No Fallacy	That's definitely fair.  That you took the time to read what I wrote is what matters.  It is a shame I couldn't sway your opinion, but it is what it is.   In my opinion I don't think changing how Colour Identity interacts with Hybrid cards is in any way is against the spirit of the format.  I'll concede that my suggestion for the 2-brid cards was probably a bad one.  I can agree that they should stay as their singular colours instead of my idea of making them colourless.  However with concerns to the fun of deck building for the format, I have always found some restrictions non-sensical.  Why can I only play [[Scapheap Scrounger]] in a Black deck?  Why do I have to be running White **and** Red to play Archangel Avacyn?  I think that the current rules around Colour Identity are in some aspects too restrictive and actually ruin some of the fun that could be had in the deckbuilding process.
No Fallacy	"Who defines ""accurate information""? This study can be used either way."
No Fallacy	I think the whole trans movement is a conspiracy. Shit came outta no where. In some cases kids as young as 3 years old are transitioning. Whos behind this sick shit?

No Fallacy	The problem is they think just like you
No Fallacy	Slippery fucking slope these politicians are on.
No Fallacy	Even the most obvious assumptions have to be tested against proof. That's the scientific method. Just taking common sense or intuition as truth without evidence, is a slippery slope to holding all sorts of inaccurate ideas, which we all do collectively (see the success of debunks in popular scientific content). At the very least, even if you happened to be right all along, you still get to quantify things more accurately.
No Fallacy	The problem is that we spend money on lots of morally contentious things, like war. And letting one group of people decide that another group of people shouldn't receive funding for something is a bad precedent. That allows marginalized people to really get screwed over.   If something is legal, then funding shouldn't be withheld due to other people's moral issues with it.  Integrated schools used to be a morally contentious issue.

You've never been allowed to harass people about their dps numbers if SE catches wind of it and has proof of you harassing them.

No Fallacy	Holy shit. I don't have anything to say about this other than that sounds like something out of a dystopian novel...   Also, it's not like there aren't married people who still chose to get abortions.
No Fallacy	That would be nearly impossible to do, plus it's a slippery slope to eugenics 2.0
No Fallacy	Slippery slope. On one side you have the first amendment protecting their right to protest on the other you have healthcare privacy and access that these protesters impede. Would you want to cross a picket line to access healthcare? It is not an easy issue to tackle but I commend anyone willing to try.  Edit: thank you for the reminding me how bad of an idea it is to comment on anything on this sub.
No Fallacy	Very slippery slope there.

No Fallacy	All true, i will say however parental instinct saved my childs life. She was ill and i brought her to hospital, doctor told me it was a viral infection, plenty of bed rest and fluids, wrote a script for some meds and was about to leave. I said hold on a second, this feels like appendicitis to me. I said i wanted a second opinion. 2nd doctor came in, felt her stomach, checked her with the ultrasound and went white. Within 2 minutes we were running for the OR.   Scientific? No. but would i give it up for all the tea in china. Not on your life. Or my childs.
No Fallacy	They should both drop the arguments from authority, not that focusing on the science (not the degrees) unlikely to turn an anti-vaxxer around, but it's a step in the right direction.
No Fallacy	I am 14 and this is deep level of reply right there!
No Fallacy	It's interesting that people who will defend shitty stuff because it's in the constitution tend to be the same people who will defend shitty stuff because it's in the Bible.

No Fallacy	A couple things, COVID-19 is the disease, the virus is SARS-CoV-2.  We know it is a virus because we can inject the virus into an organism and it will have an immune response, viral load will increase, and will display symptoms or die. They have already infected animals at my university and so think we would find out if they showed no signs of infection.
No Fallacy	"Truth, no. However, perception of truth can be manipulated as long as you have ""expert"" status and people still believe anyone with a title uncritically.  Thankfully, it seems more people are starting to notice the man behind the curtain due to the increasing abandon many ""experts"" (especially in journalism) are exposing their bias."
No Fallacy	Funny cause I also have a PhD in astrophysics and they never taught us anything about climate change. Not to defend the guy screaming scam, but that's a misleading comeback.
No Fallacy	&gt; Capitalism is the natural order of things.  Wrong.   https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/b0f51u/for_humans_property_is_a_social_construct_and_did/?st=k3aode83&amp;sh=745c5b67  &gt; It works without any steering.   That doesn't make it natural.   &gt; It develops naturally (like in a prison economy where cigarettes become the currency)  No, it does not develop naturally. It requires a lot of steering to implement the conditions that must exist in order for market dynamics to come about in the first place.
No Fallacy	No fan of how the CCP has used WHO as a political tool, but it should be noted that Aso is famously a misogynistic, homophobic, xenophobic ass.
No Fallacy	I knew it the comment section would change into that.  If you are sad, it doesn't mean you are intelligent. Tons of stupid people are sad too
No Fallacy	No, but it's an appeal to authority. Most people are more likely to listen to an opinion if they belive the person is an expert. That doesn't make it any more true, but it helps convince those that haven't figured it out for themselves.
No Fallacy	"Not necessarily. I know that the earth isn't flat. Someone told me the arguments and even proved it scientifically. But I cannot remember any of the arguments except ""you can kind of see it if you look at the horizon"". Doesn't make it less true though"
No Fallacy	Not exactly the same thing, bub. The moon is fairly sizable, 6k miles across I think, and fairly close at 240k miles.   Stars are hundreds of thousands if not millions of miles across, and millions and billions of miles away.    Your graphic is nowhere near accurate.
No Fallacy	Pathetic and disgusting.  Its an absolute certainty that this game will never even be 50% of what Chris Roberts promised it would be.  I hope people form a class action and take back the millions and millions of dollars that he (and other executives) have drawn out in salaries over the years.  Imagine taking MILLIONS and MILLIONS of backer funds before having finished even 30 percent of what you promised you would deliver.  It really is criminal.    Karma is going to come back and ruin CR for good.  I GUARANTEE IT.    I wont put another cent into this shit ever again, unless they actually can make REAL progress as opposed to a bunch of diversion type shit.  Planet tech v5.... How about fucking finishing any of the 10+ major gameplay loops that actually make it a fucking game (and not just a screenshot sim)?  What a disaster.  Its 100% clear that they just cant add anything of substance because of tech limitations.  They wont admit it, but its the indisputable truth.  I still got enough out of it for my initial $100, but any money beyond that is just gone.  Risks are risks, and this one turned sour.  Sorry Chris, but you are a delusional liar/snake oil salesman.  I hope that you get what you deserve.
No Fallacy	Have a look at how the EU is doing (not Europen Countries but the EU itself). Useless, no one listens, no support, no money, no direction. Exactly as effective as a world government would be.
No Fallacy	My argument is not that having black friends clears you of all charges of racism. My argument clearly states that it is simply not immediately invalid and should be looked into further. You're interpreting things in my claim that aren't there.
No Fallacy	Appeal to authority. Socialist Propaganda alert.
No Fallacy	Beware of anyone who uses the Rule of Law to justify their position.   Rule of Law is not an end unto itself.  Rule of Law is a means to an end; that being Justice.
No Fallacy	"Nice appeal to authority! From an evolutionary perspective, humans ate meat, but that has little merit on what we should do in a modern context. If it was true that we were ""designed to be omnivores"", how come no other omnivorous/carnivorous animal can develop atherosclerosis, yet humams do? Atherosclerosis is distinctly a disease only herbivores suffer from. For every other omnivorous/carnivorous animal, eating meat is either sufficient or necessary, yet for humans it is neither necessary nor sufficient for survival."
No Fallacy	When you're actually talking about a person who is an authority in the field then no.
No Fallacy	NTA - I say this specifically because the teacher should have taken a second look at his information the first time you told him that it was incorrect rather than doubling down. A good teacher would realize that they don't have expertise in a specific field (since knowing that your blood isn't blue is pretty common knowledge) and would have done extra research to find the truth.  Frankly, I think you did a great job doing what you did. Assuming you weren't rude in your correspondence with the teacher, it's important to call people of authority out when they are wrong and it is also important to have those people then take responsibility for being wrong.
No Fallacy	Cliff notes?
No Fallacy	"It's not appeal to authority to say something like ""Science man says thing about science, is probably right"" though. It is if you do ""Science man says something about politics, is probably right"" (At least to my understanding of it)"
No Fallacy	It's not an irrational behavior. A mainstream economist becomes a mainstream economist by making statements that are generally acceptable.
No Fallacy	Except science say it is, im moderation and without porn
No Fallacy	Unluckily, this brings no facts to the table, just an appeal to authority.  It seems I have to look somewhere else for a constructive discussion...
No Fallacy	"As a parents, I'd say nope, that's not it. Not for most parents anyhow. Most parents don't assume that what their kids do reflects who their kids are. Think about it: babies are emotional wrecks who scream to get what they want and think only of themselves. But parents don't think they're ""bad"" because this is developmentally normal. Teens attach existential meaning to every interaction they have, think mainly of themselves and their peers, and respond dramatically to tiny things. But (good) parents don't think they're ""bad"" because this is developmentally normal."
No Fallacy	When is someone qualified to give advice? Does someone have to have experienced something similar to what the person being advised is going through? Does age matter? Does the one giving advise have to know everything and anything that needs to be known about a situation?
No Fallacy	If he is fine thats his decision I don't get why you need to make a thread about it. I have nothing against teapot or any Anet partner but if they decide to leave I don't think they want it to become a big story.
No Fallacy	> piracy either makes them money   That wouldn't be true, otherwise they'd remove DRM.
No Fallacy	I'll just leave this here for those with a functioning brain:  [https://www.logicallyfallacious.com/tools/lp/Bo/LogicalFallacies/21/Appeal-to-Authority](https://www.logicallyfallacious.com/tools/lp/Bo/LogicalFallacies/21/Appeal-to-Authority)
No Fallacy	Admittedly, we don't have enough info to know if OP's doctor has any sort of decent and recent nutritional education, especially as to how it pertains to IR PCOS.  He might be right on top of all the latest research, or he might be repeating decades old and largely outdated advice.
No Fallacy	"""someone smarter than you believes it"" - such a bullshit argument."
No Fallacy	https://www.cbpp.org/research/social-security/social-security-lifts-more-americans-above-poverty-than-any-other-program  Literally the first article in a google search.  These people aren't just ignorant, they're WILLFULLY ignorant which makes them even worse.
No Fallacy	Wait you want to support journals that have no cached authority in the subject?
No Fallacy	The Bible says...
No Fallacy	   Yes, I do support stoning and the cutting of a thiefs hand.  And why should the solution be different? To say that the law is barbaric, uncivilised, or so on, is to say that God supported barbaric actions as did his Prophet     . And is that true? And then, who decided these things are outdated? Have we suddenly become more righteous, or more moral than God and the Prophet     ?  But please be careful with what you advocate, and Im not being a  or accusing you of , but if a person thinks that their own laws, or other laws whatever they may be, is superior to Gods law, then that is an act of . And once again, Im not accusing you of anything, because I dont have the jurisdiction, and I dont know what your complete opinions are.
No Fallacy	There's nothing to trust. You read it and consider the arguments it lays out. Then you can come here and share your ideas of those arguments
No Fallacy	Hmm. A piece on brietbart about Democrats. This is surely unbiased, as is the person who went there to read it and post it here.
No Fallacy	Lol. Tbf I assume deep down you know all forms of confidence aren't attractive?  Like be assertive at work doesn't mean slap your boss and tell him to stop interrupting you right?  So likewise being confident is one thing then basically telling a physicist they are wrong about the laws of relativity from a half remembered you tube video isn't that attractive to anyone?
No Fallacy	"Because a lot of people assume that if someone is an ""expert"" (an expert on what doesn't matter, just as long as they can be referred to as an ""expert""), then that person can be relied upon to only give us expert opinions backed up by facts, no matter the subject.   It's the man in the labcoat phenomenon writ-large; you have to attack the credibility of a person when that person is using their credibility in place of an argument.  When someone is (essentially) saying ""I'm a doctor, so just trust what I say."", it's entirely logical to say back ""Just because you're a medical doctor doesn't mean you know jack squat about a non-medical subject."""
No Fallacy	The kind of douche that thinks their titles and degrees define them, and loathe everyone making more of an impact in the world than they are. Did I sum it up well enough? 
No Fallacy	Your proof is blog posts and YouTube videos. Good to see youve really done your research
No Fallacy	Having trust in scientific leaders isnt exactly the same thing as having trust in scientists though.   I have a lot more trust in company employees than I do most company leaders.
No Fallacy	I would love to know what your qualifications are to diagnose someone with a neurocognitive disorder.
No Fallacy	Conversely, being an expert on something doesnt mean you know what its like to be a victim of something.
No Fallacy	"You may have a point here, but it's not just YouTube. I'm thinking of Dawkins and ""Dear Muslima"", and of various things I've heard of The Amazing Meeting."
No Fallacy	You shouldnt be upset about X. Other people have it worse  Okay? Just because other people have it worse doesnt mean that I dont feel bad. Piss off.
No Fallacy	"A story about a club in japan based on rape... all the top comments ""US soldiers are raping pieces of shit""  Whatever... downvote me "
No Fallacy	"I never really liked the whole ""it could be worse"" statement. I get that it's meant to invoke the idea to cherish what you have, but it ends up turning into a depressing arms race. I get things could be worse, but damn do things still suck."
No Fallacy	This isn't greeks community. If you were a 10+ Month viewer you would know
No Fallacy	Well is he wrong? The death rate for people under 65 is 0.2%
No Fallacy	">They think that just because i have "" stuff they would've wanted in their childhood"" (just an xbox and a guitar) i can't be sad or angry?  Fallacy of relative privation. You're viewing your situation as bad by a reasonable standard, but someone not having an Xbox or a guitar doesn't suddenly make your life sunshine and rainbows."
No Fallacy	Well, at least your problem isnt as bad as (usually something about starving African children), etc.   Yes, some people do have it worse but so what? People are allowed to feel pain and saying that doesnt solve anybodys problem. While sometimes it makes *me* feel better when I tell myself this, I would never say this to someone else.
No Fallacy	Why is everyone here gatekeeping bad working environments? Just because you had it worse doesn't mean they shouldn't have it better
No Fallacy	"Without more said, this is just a run of the mill non sequitur:  1) X was bad. 2) Therefore, X must have happened.  I suppose if you want to find a specific name for this sort of thing you might plumb for ""overreaction bias,"" but that's at best just throwing something out there, when really, the sort of reasoning you provide is just bad for other reasons."
No Fallacy	How about.  Crazy thought.  We both don't rape and fix the deficit?  We could spend our time that we're not raping fixing the deficit n
No Fallacy	Omg there was 7 of them!
No Fallacy	Honestly, this one isnt that bad
No Fallacy	"> \>""We want a better format for an *open* web""  > \>Access to the video is restricted by DRM  "
No Fallacy	y
No Fallacy	"Ah, the classic ""other people have it worse than you, so you're not depressed"" argument"
No Fallacy	Cutting parts off the genitals?  Of children or infants who can't consent?  According to the wishes of the parents?  For any reason, ranging from sexual suppression to religion to misquoted medical texts?  The opposite sex thinks its weird to see non-mutilated genitals?  Ok then how are they not the same?
No Fallacy	"I always hated the ""other people have it worse"" argument. It doesn't solve my problem or the other person's so why even bring it up?"
No Fallacy	It could always be worse.  or At least you dont have it as bad as ...   So like your only allowed to feel suffering if you have the absolute worse possible situation at any given time? Are you only allowed to be happy if you have the absolute best situation at a given point in time?
No Fallacy	There are starving children in Africa  I hear people say it all the time when others are complaining about their (first world) problems.   Just because someone else has it worse doesnt mean your feelings arent valid
No Fallacy	"I don't get why NTs have the ""If they're starving children in Africa then your problems are irrelevant"" mindset."
No Fallacy	I'm sure the slave owners' whips would have made an excellent percussion section.
No Fallacy	A-fucking-greed. Tons of them are coming because of the violence left in the wake of our meddling and our war on drugs. Is it as bad as the Holocaust? I don't know, probably not, but it doesn't mean it isn't a walk in the park. I know I'd want to get out of my country if it had similar levels of turmoil.
No Fallacy	Using the suffering of one group to deflect from the suffering of another. Divide and rule tactics comrades. Call them out on it and stay assertive.
No Fallacy	> It's easy enough for someone to say that to a stranger, but it'll be harder when their own children grow to despise them for being born into a cruel and uncaring world  This is the perfect retort.  
No Fallacy	"because ""it happens in other places too""is never a good reason to not address an issue?  "
No Fallacy	"""It can't be bad if there are things that are worse!""  Literally the dumbest argument possible. Good job."
No Fallacy	Its like they do a bunch of liberal fluff with no underlying progressive or journalistic ethos. They are as bad as fox in my opinion
No Fallacy	I mean this type of shit got found out for fraternities in America too so.
No Fallacy	"I just wonder when somebody will come saying ""There is famine in Africa, how dare you care about another problem on your doorstep"". Remind me please, how was this method of invalidation called? I'm sure there was a name to it."
No Fallacy	Yet, failures like you support Obama who would happily kill others for the hell of it. You are a failure, also Obama did nothing to combat Ebola and that was horrible in itself.
No Fallacy	Might blow some minds here: There are actual atheistic religions out there. It seems like modern, especially 'western' ideas of atheism have turned away from belief in no god or gods (ie rejection of monotheism and polytheism) and has shifted to rejection of all religion. This isn't accurate! You can, in fact, not believe in a god or gods and be strictly religious, adhere to an afterlife, etc.  
No Fallacy	Advertisement for what? Political campaign or something else?
No Fallacy	As per usual Cyborg is whining about the weight cut , while training heavy, and munching down 200 gram of protein a day.  She is the fat girl munching down fucking burgers while crying about her fast metabolism.  Her defenders are fucking deluded.
No Fallacy	I hate, hate, HATE the argument that doctors' judgement is suspect because of thalidomide use in the 1960s. FFS - doctors were the people who observed and reported the teratogenic harms of thalidomide because *their babies were the ones affected by it*. They were the ones who kicked up the stink and challenged Chemie Grnenthal GmbH for selling it without the appropriate safeguards and tests.   If anything, this argument about doctors makes them exactly NOTHING like HAES activists, because doctors change their practice when evidence suggests that what they were doing previously was harmful or ineffective - and yet, despite the overabundance of evidence disproving the idea that the morbidly obese can be equivalently healthy to thin people, HAES/FAs aren't moving on.   They are the quacks. Not doctors. 
No Fallacy	"How is it that so many of you can blame all Donald trump supporters for this, calling them nazis, when (most likely) this act of insanity was commited by a lone psychopath? How do most of you not see that this smear campaign of Donald trump supporters is a mass effort to escalate hatred, and therefor, hostilities between Americans. Most people, trump supporters or haters, are just regular Americans that don't want escalation or vile hatred. This is all about creating a rift between We The People. This lunatic deserves the gallows, but this isn't a coordinates effort by ""evil nazis""."
No Fallacy	I like your mom's thinking. Hogwarts must be real too because it's in the harry potter book.
No Fallacy	"Like the communities that agreed it was ok to say things ""No blacks after sundown?"" How does libertarianism deal with tyranny of the majority? If libertarian demographic numbers are any indicator, it doesn't."
No Fallacy	Many people are violating #3. From all sides of the political spectrum.
No Fallacy	More so, they believe social media is great. You believe social media is harmful and thus anything they say is suspect.
No Fallacy	some Christians. All-encompassing generalization aren't very accurate.
No Fallacy	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_true_Scotsman  If it doesn't apply to you then it doesn't apply to you. However, I know that it would apply to some.
No Fallacy	**[directedlight](http://para.ms/reus/directedlight)**: [^^original ^^reddit ^^link](http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1iosxn/a/cb6moza/?cb6kkp5)  Sagan doesn't really go into history as much as he talks about the history of pseudoscience.  It is better to learn something like the [Trivium method](http://triviumeducation.com/) before doing your own research. The Trivium method gives a great toolset for anybody to learn and research for themselves.  It is also very helpful to learn about [fallacies](http://www.nizkor.org/features/fallacies/), as well.
No Fallacy	If there's one thing that unnerves me, it's someone being piss-poor at their job being taken as a bad example of their entire company.  A lot of jobs you've worked have that one guy.  You would not want that one guy lumped in with you.  Think, man.  If more folks deliberately painted the brush wide like this, your whole reputation could be ruined because of an idiot you already mistrust, but don't happen to have the desire or ability to fire.  I've never had a USPS issue.  I've also never worked for USPS.  So I see something like this, and all I can think is, maybe he's just that guy.  Or just new and dumb.  Or just good/lucky at not getting caught before today.
No Fallacy	I know the feeling, the foaming-at-the-mouth atheists on reddit seem to think that everyone on reddit cares about their deisre to lambaste religion. In reality I just want to read cool wikipedia articles.   edit: not to say this article wasn't interesting, but was the overt anti-religious title needed? really?
No Fallacy	Idiots who say this are totally ignorant of the dynamics surrounding 'forgiveness' in N families,  either because they had normal parents or because they refuse to believe a parent can be a narcissistic, abusive asshat.   To Ns, 'forgiveness' is something they are ENTITLED to and that you are OBLIGATED to give them. They also see it as permission to CONTINUE their shitty behavior towards you.   People who say that are also likely to be flying monkeys for the N, usually friends or family members of the N.
No Fallacy	They didn't prove their point at all, the thought experiment made no real sense nor addressed consequences at all, and trying to make arguments without exhausting all options or through exclusion to serve your point is neither logic nor philosophy.
No Fallacy	"The number one circle-jerk I hate: ""I'm atheist, but I think other atheists are smug"". Goddamnit, *you* found a way to be fucking smug about not being smug, and have the guts to call us smug?  Also, saying ""we *do* know how life originated"" isn't a smug way to show our knowledge, it's a factual statement."
No Fallacy	This is a common tactic used by any group dishonestly pushing an agenda, which includes bashing cops, races, political parties, or pretty much anything. I'm sure there's a term coined for this, but it escapes me at the moment.
No Fallacy	I want to see his fallacies get broken down 
No Fallacy	"While I'm generally not a fan of this ""We talked about X, now I get ads for X"" thing (it always reeks of confirmation bias), you do realize that  1. Your friend is browsing without an adblocker. Who even does that??  2. Telegram is not end-to-end encrypted (by default, anyway, and the desktop client doesn't have the option at all). If you really care about whether a service is private, you should pick one that ticks that box at least."
No Fallacy	Remember that there are over 30 ongoing national emergencies issued by presidents since the 70s. This is no big deal; but of course people need something to complain about in order to keep their narrative alive about how every Republican president is the reincarnation of Hitler. Trump ain't great but he isn't evil. It wasn't to long ago Bush was Hitler, and his father before him was Hitler. Oh and Reagan was Hitler too. Lmao
No Fallacy	I've also never experienced homophobia. I've also never had the flu but that still exists. I have had friends in other countries (read: America) who have faced discrimination and violence because of who they are. Just because YOU haven't experienced it doesn't mean it isn't there. And most of my friends aren't the stereotype you describe. They're like me but they live somewhere else. Bad things happen and pretending they don't is dangerous.
No Fallacy	oooooooo in [this](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Percentage-of-children-who-reported-being-bullied-or-bullying-others-according-to_tbl2_259247829) study, 45.4% of boys in the group admitted they have bullied someone while only 29.7% of the girls said they bullied someone.

No Fallacy	I always love when I try to point out critical feminism or any of the one of the many facets of feminism and the chauvinists get so butt hurt. 
No Fallacy	Nice PR stunt from a company that wouldn't touch anything on my car under warranty. Pricks.  Edit: Downvotes from the shills on this subreddit (you aren't subtle) and because everybody and their mother fangirls over toyotas overpriced underperforming vehicles & can't accept they are no different than any other business out there. They are a shady company with shady business practices, but people let it slide because ???
No Fallacy	There's literally a damage multiplier setting in the MCM, proving again that people don't really care about the MCM.
No Fallacy	"No one wants to take your guns.  I bet people will post in this thread saying ""Okay, I know we said no one wants to take your guns and you were crazy for thinking so, but we actually do want to take your guns, and here's why that's a good thing"""
No Fallacy	Why has this greater fools thing suddenly become the hit saying among new users?
No Fallacy	Sorry kids, forgot r/politics is an echo chamber. I just state a simple truth about my life and get attacked, I see how it is. What use is this board if one cannot have a decent discussion?
No Fallacy	We don't kill people.   We're providing taxpayer funded medical service to people who are coming and entering illegally.  Anecdotal stories of sick kids or people dying in custody are shameful examples of demagoguery.
No Fallacy	your idea is TLDR
No Fallacy	"Oh boy - one of the three ""triggered feminist"" images! What a rare treat!"
No Fallacy	TIL people working together = communism
No Fallacy	Your dad is just stuck in a result orientedmindset. As long as he gets results, aka I won maxing E, he wont care whats optimal.   Tbh its a fair assessment. If 85% efficiency is working why try  to do 99%. Its hard to argue with that when the goal is winning not be the best blitz in the world.
No Fallacy	So are you saying vaccines cause autism? As in, smoking definitely causes lung cancer. Lung cancer can also be caused by living in a heavily polluted environment. The link is direct.   Also, I wouldn't draw similarities between Autism and Cancer. Autism is not a disease. 
No Fallacy	Bernie is a socialist. My family fled Venezuela to escape that bullshit
No Fallacy	Bananas at Trader Joe's are .15 and I live in WA. And it costs 50$ for my family of 4 to go eat at a resturaunt (including tip) Is what she's saying a straw man argument? I have a hard time remembering what all the arguments are called.
No Fallacy	Use your precious science to shut me down. How hard can it be?   Btw, millions of people would tell you the same. 
No Fallacy	Yeah, gave up playing the other day because of this.  Strangely, some people were claiming the server was fine, and others were experiencing the same problems.  Not sure of the people claiming the servers were fine were just being arseholes.
No Fallacy	The one that shits me off is 'Natural = good/healthy', and that 'Artificial = bad/unhealthy'  As if our species hasn't spent millenia creating un-natural buildings and cities for comfortable living, or developing un-natural vaccines and antibiotics to treat all the very natural diseases that have killed billions.
No Fallacy	"I'm all for legalisation of weed, but I hate the whole ""weed can't be illegal/dangerous, it's a natural plant"" argument. As if there aren't loads of highly toxic plants out there  Edit: ffs everyone, I'm not saying weed is dangerous, I'm saying that the fact that it's natural doesn't preclude it from being dangerous and not everything that is natural should necessarily be legal. But weed should be legal, because it's not dangerous, but not because it's natural."
No Fallacy	Dont cry, Santa is a man and Mrs Clause is a women, like nature intended.
No Fallacy	Sam's point is that the apparent mismatch between is/ought collapses if you want to talk about *morality*. It is a scientific fact about the universe that conscious creatures can feel pain and want to avoid it.
No Fallacy	&gt;  It's as if she read a couple articles on the topic and decided the entire field is unscientific...  Yeah. This woman is totally unequipped, right?   https://cola.unh.edu/person/subrena-smith  Troll harder.
No Fallacy	"That makes sense, though I guess the reasoning behind the consumption of animals like cows and pigs for food tends to come from a ""food chain"" view of our place in the world, which is in itself a moral dilemma."
No Fallacy	Early 1900's British philosopher G.E. Moore termed this the Naturalistic Fallacy
No Fallacy	Ummmm, you realize Organic doesn't mean pesticide free, right?  It just means they used organic pesticides which do the exact same thing as their non organic counterpart.
No Fallacy	Science
No Fallacy	"Using ""its natural"" or ""unnatural"" to explain why something is good or bad"
No Fallacy	"This is my main complaint against people against kratom.  I tolerate and respond to kratom better than SSRIs with less cost and side effects.  I'm not even a person. Who thinks ""natural is better""; I have no issues with trying a synthetic drug, I care whether or not its effective. That fact that kratom is natural is just very convenient. I would happily take a pharmaceutical if it could do what the unregulated and natural kratom leaf does."
No Fallacy	So how does stapling (presumably) a pedometer to a pig prove to the consumer that the pig is actually free-range?  Yes the people raising the pig know that its free-range, but the consumer still has to trust the pig farmer when they're told that it actually is.
No Fallacy	This is actually a scientifically proven phenomenon
No Fallacy	Exactly
No Fallacy	I hate the argument towards human natural behaviour so much because people who argue like that ignore that from the moment of birth, humans are socialised. There are even studies that show how music, food and other stuff during the pregnancy influences the child.  But even if it were true that being selfish comes naturally....so does rape but we as humans learned (at least for a bigger part) that rape is wrong. These people are just fundamentally broken and unable to have any coherent thought that won't contradict itself.
No Fallacy	We live in that reality already with few exceptions. Its called equal opportunity but you cant legislate the human proclivity of prejudice, jealous, envy or any of our other sins. Also cant control who your parents are or where you grow up, or your immediate community, which heavily skew the results.
No Fallacy	Just because its endogenous doesn't make it good, im not saying weed or thc is bad im just saying this isnt a good argument for it. Dmt is endogenous, opioids are endogenous, it needs to be on a substance to substance basis and not naturalist bias
No Fallacy	Monsanto doesnt even exist anymore. It was acquired by Bayer.
No Fallacy	Those two are my absolute main faves. Dr. Eric berg and Dr. Nick Zyrowski are also good. 
No Fallacy	I was already a no processed meats, not gluten, no artificial sweeteners kind of person before keto. Is it not common knowledge that processed meats should be avoided for ketoers?
No Fallacy	"> I think it boils down to a biological imperative: the more promiscuous the mother of your children, the less likely her children are yours. Spending resources raising other people's kids is a genetic dead end, and would be selected against. As far as ""that was in the past"", the past is all we have to go on.  That whole thread is Red Pill thought on steroids."
No Fallacy	Why is it important that she is vegan?
No Fallacy	Is there an advantage over artificial sweeteners like sucralose? These are generally regarded safe too.
No Fallacy	You could just as easily say humans are meant to murder and assault each other. Just because something is natural doesnt mean its right.
No Fallacy	Altering our environment got us into this mess. Altering our environment isnt going to get us out of this mess.  Say it louder for the people in the back.
No Fallacy	What's more natural than not eating what your body was designed to eat?
No Fallacy	How strong is this argument?
No Fallacy	The idea that something natural is inherently good but something chemical/synthetic is bad is just wrong, but very widespread.
No Fallacy	"I mean people say this to anyone they disagree with, I've heard ""going outside"" is also a cure for feminism, gayness, and leftist beliefs."
No Fallacy	Ohhhhh....dont get me started on those twat fuckers.   The self righteousness of potheads is unmatched by any other
No Fallacy	Poisonous plants, large and/or carnivorous animals, cliffs, earthquakes, droughts, floods, storms, bacteria, and viruses are natural too. Just because its natural doesnt make it any less painful or potentially lethal.  Natural  Safe
No Fallacy	It isnt the government that wont let me find facts, its big pharma. They duped the goverment and the rest of the world, including my parents. The vaccines my parents forced onto me as a child are the cause of my [GENERAL MALAISE]. I would never repeat the same awful decisions that my parents did.  Vaccines arent natural, we survived for thousands of years without them but all of a sudden we need a toxic injection to survive? Big pharma are the cause of the opioid episemic and have caused so much more havoc but you choose to trust them on this? Ill have you know that [X MEDICAL PROBLEM] never existed before vaccines.  Basically just a naturalistic fallicy on repeat.
No Fallacy	Ive been vegetarian all my life and I honestly think vegans who argue this lack some brainpower. Nothing in nature was destined for anything but your body has evolved to be able to process it and use its nutrition.
No Fallacy	I'm not an anti-natalist, but no... Not every woman needs to be a mother. There are men that don't like the whole kid thing who aren't anti-natalists, its not right for a man who pump and dump his DNA into a woman and use his job as an excuse to avoid the responsibility of raising a kid. The concept of motherhood is very religious like. Most species eat their children.
No Fallacy	By this same logic:  * Stepdads should murder all their wives' children by other men (like lions)  * Rape should be pretty much fine (so...SO many animals)  * Women should eat the heads off of the men they have sex with (like Mantises)  and so many other fucked up things because animals do fucked up shit a lot and WE SHOULDN'T FUCKING COPY THEM
No Fallacy	"I think you posted this in the anti vegan sub right? Or you copy pasted from someone else's post there.  Overall, this is essentially an 'ancestors though' excuse. ""Our ancestors did things this way, so therefore it's the only way and the best way."" That is clearly not automatically true, in many areas of life, yet many anti-vegans use this as the epitome of their argument against veganism and give it no further thought.   Anyway...  If you can ignore the fringe vegans who literally think humans are herbivores (I mean honestly... believing humans never did, physically can't/shouldn't eat meat is not a requirement for being vegan and most of us do know that we are omnivores) and really evaluate the technology and resources we now have access to as modern humans, then the discussion about whether humans should be eating meat and animal products can be more productive and realistic given the context within which we now make our dietary choices."
No Fallacy	Holistic and alternative medicines aren't going to do anything. Something is either medicinal, or it's not. Holistic remedies fall under then 'not' section.
No Fallacy	I don't find Canada in the wrong either, but I find it really weird how much news on issues of standing law are framed by polling data.  Like this isn't about a group pushing to change a law; this is just reporting on the situation mostly but somehow the popularity matters? I haven't really been paying attention so maybe I'm just now noticing it.
No Fallacy	"&gt; 54,000 people thought it was appropriate for ""world news""  I laugh at people who appeal to the vote count for why something should not be removed from a subreddit. As if redditors do not upvote dumb, irrelevant, shit all the time.   Most people don't check what subreddit something is in before upvoting."
No Fallacy	Better than any of the shit on right now. Wrestling was more popular at that time then it is now. Raw ratings have hit record lows recently. Everything you said with the exception of the era possibly being dead is wrong 
No Fallacy	1.Lets consider Abrahamic god since shes the most popular .  2. If she can read your thoughts shouldnt be able to control your actions too ? Or have affects in you surround causing you to believe ? 3. Depends on how you look at it you can be  religious and not be a nutcase like most people unless you are not fully informed of your religion and think throwing money at everything which says its religiouses is gonna get you a ticket to heaven
No Fallacy	The logic doesn't follow. Unless you also think there must have been a real Zeus, Ah-Puch, Odin, and Xenu.  Or a real bunny to bring you candy, a real fairy to take your teeth, or maybe a real monster under the bed.  Just because a lot of people believe something in no way means it was based on any form of reality.
No Fallacy	The scientific method.  Most people seem to think that scientific truth is determined by vote.
No Fallacy	Remember when OC was just getting hot and these upset ass fans on here always had something negative to say about his character? Turns out he got over as all fuck and they just come off like jim Cornette?
No Fallacy	Because an entire industry has been formed around Docker?  CI systems, cloud deployment, etc...
No Fallacy	Easy karma in /r/asoiaf. But what is karma against the words of the writer who told us many times why we should not expect to see such high magic tinfoil in ASOIAF?  * https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/778lc8/spoilers_extended_magic_and_the_tinfoil/  * https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/9llfjq/spoilers_extended_george_rr_martin_on_the_hardest/  * https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/9pjldr/spoilers_extended_law_talk_george_r_r_martin_date/  * https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/a0aqte/spoilers_extended_george_r_r_martin_on_fire_blood/ 
No Fallacy	The belief is common, but that doesn't mean it's justified and it definitely doesn't mean that it's correct.
No Fallacy	Whoa.... Brains are weird man
No Fallacy	^ Debunked Russian talking points.
No Fallacy	Why does it always seem like the announcers saying shutout affects us when we're working on one but when the opposition is it's like superstitions aren't real. :P
No Fallacy	The problem here is that most people don't hate anyone because of who they are. That's what most leftist don't understand. Sure, there are a few that say they hate people and actually mean it, but mostly it's not about hate. The majority of people there didn't hate LGBT, minorities, or feminists. We were just tired of hearing about how oppressed they were and how they had no rights, and how they deserved so much more. We were all for equal rights, but equal rights means exactly that: equal. You don't get to celebrate your differences, your differences don't make you better than us. Thta's not equality means. If you want to celebrate your differences, then don't get pissy when straight white men want to celebrate their differences as well. It was calling out the very obvious double standard that the left doesn't seem to want to mention.
No Fallacy	I said it before and I say it again:  Asking for people's opinions about complex matters and then displaying them as if that was something that should be done is making about as much sense as asking a my dog whether she would like of the chocolate that I am eating.   That's how you got Brexit. Stop asking ignorant masses about complex decisions without educating them first.
No Fallacy	"Based on your username, I'm going to say this is a case of ""to a worm in horseradish, the whole world is horseradish"".  Here's how unpopular bike trials are amongst the average person. I have three bikes in my living room, and another 2 in the next room over, I watch the tour de france every summer, I've raced on a velodrome, and I had just had to google what bike trials were.   You think the average person who isn't into bikes has ever watched bike trials?"
No Fallacy	The news article said it was a pitbull, the guy in the video identified it as a pitbull, etc...
No Fallacy	"Well, she is actually successful in her own right, so...    Haha fine, downvote me for pointing out that she is actually successful in pretty much everything she does. Is that because of her name? Probably, but she has actually made something of herself and all of this ""DAE Kim is a stupid waste"" is pretty old by now."
No Fallacy	>>They don't care how they work in detail, they just accept their musical merits.
No Fallacy	I believe that's how it works.
No Fallacy	I'm really trying to view this impartially but the amount of logical fallacies Cruz makes is hard to look past. To be fair Bernie had his fair share as well besides just not having good poise on camera, and Cruz is an excellent debater, but man...
No Fallacy	Don't know why you got downvoted for citing actual statistics unlike anyone else in this thread...
No Fallacy	Is Trump in the videos pushing people off of roofs or beating kids who need crutches to walk?
No Fallacy	"'Argumentum ad populum' - the fallacious argument that concludes that a proposition must be true because many or most people believe it, often concisely encapsulated as: ""If many believe so, it is so.""    Many people believing in one thing does not stand as evidence for its truth. Unfortunately there is a solid chance that Jesus never did the things people said he did. He may have never even existed. "
No Fallacy	The difference is that that if reality is an illusion, it's a shared one. It is not necessary to believe in Gravity. It affects you identically whether you believe in it or not.         Faith however, while it may be shared, only works for those who believe. 
No Fallacy	Argumentum ad populum. There was a time when the consensus of scientists agreed that the earth is flat. Consensus is politics not science. Science doesnt care how many people believe something. Using this as an argument has degraded the intellectual integrity of the topic and turned it into a political discussion instead of one about facts.  Discuss facts not beliefs, this isnt politics or religion. 
No Fallacy	"> The reality is this: the more overweight people accept themselves, the more Tovar accepts herself.  And that, ladies and gentlemen, is the ""Fat Acceptance"" movement in a nutshell. "
No Fallacy	Every. Fucking. Time.
No Fallacy	This bothers me a lot, too, and I blame the media.. and people who won't do their own fact checking. (I wind up irritated a lot, especially during political seasons)  Most job-for-job studies I've seen put the wage gap in the 90s somewhere, varying by industry, so it's not entirely nonexistent. Anecdotally, that's what I've seen IRL, too.  Arguing with people who blindly spout bad statistics is an exercise in futility. I feel for you. :( 
No Fallacy	Democracy
No Fallacy	get banned from science and philosophy subreddits for pointing out that peer review and argumentum ad populum don't create facts and truth, like me, then you can talk
No Fallacy	"> There are more Christians now than ever before.   Why would that matter?  >US-based Pew Research Centre analysed demographic change among the world's major religions and found that the world's population of Muslims will grow by 73 per cent between 2010 and 2050, compared to 35 per cent for Christians, the next fastest-growing faith.  > >The world's population will grow by 37 per cent over the same period. If those rates of growth continue past 2050, Muslims will outnumber Christians by 2070, the report found.  https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=my+conversion+to+islam shows ""About 628,000 results"" and for Christianity ""About 587,000 results"". I don't think we should use numbers to determine whether a faith is true or not."
No Fallacy	"Wisdom of the Crowd:  ""Well everyone else thinks that so it must be right.""  or  ""x amount of people can't be wrong.""  Yes they can be wrong and often are. Truth is not a democracy.  Edit: Well this exploded."
No Fallacy	The second is not a problem. You don't need to be compatible, just make babies and shame those who break their marriage. 
No Fallacy	Yeah, beliefs like segregation and not letting women vote.
No Fallacy	Do not be swayed by the 5 million people around the world cant be wrong argument. Yes they can be wrong and definitely are. Members are going to try everything in the book to guilt trip you  into going back. No seas una tristeza para el ungido de Dios, No seas malagradecido etc. If you have a setback in life (Illness, accident) they will tell you it is because God is punishing you. Do not let their scare tactics cloud logical reasoning. Stay strong its not easy leaving a cult. Lets call it what it is, A CULT!
No Fallacy	Heading to the centre is how you appeal to the majority of the electorate.
No Fallacy	I love how people just automatically assumes that there is something wrong on our end, when there are dozens of threads complaining about the exact same thing lol. People just think indians are retarded lol. Good thing at least we have white people's jobs to steal xD
No Fallacy	I swear. All of you are the biggest hypocrites. 
No Fallacy	this so much. I don't understand why is there so much fuss about this. So many mmos have this, even big ones like wow. As of now, it's pretty much to be expected for a game that relies on economy like crazy to have real world trading.
No Fallacy	"I used to think that with 90% of the population believing this stuff that there must be something to it. I had to be pretty arrogant to think that I was correct in my assumptions that this was all fantasy. Now I think it is a lifetime of indoctrination and brainwashing beginning from birth that as perpetuated this false ideology. I know I'm in the extreme minority especially in the middle of the ""bible belt"", but I truly believe that my eyes are finally open and I am fully awake to the fact that none of this is real. "
No Fallacy	"""This is the way we've always done it"" (In justification for something)    ANCIENT CIVILIZATIONS SACRIFICED CIVILIANS TO THE SUN GODS!  JUST BECAUSE YOU HAVE ALWAYS DONE SOMETHING DOESN'T MAKE IT A GOOD IDEA!"
No Fallacy	nah, it's an interesting problem and in every other exploit people dismiss the ToS. So I won't stop it.  But I'll remember this the next time some silly bug comes out and 2 weeks and I argue the opposite.
No Fallacy	Tradition connects us to our ancestors and our communities to their past. Tradition is a good thing. It allows us to feel connected to more than just this specific moment in time, it allows us to feel part of something bigger than ourselves.  I enjoy the growing vegan traditions and I will be enjoying my lovely nut roast this Christmas. Let's not declare war on tradition.
No Fallacy	"&gt; The biggest problem I've heard people argue against the electoral college is that it isn't Democratic. America isn't a democracy though? America is a constitutional republic. It honestly saddening how many people don't know this.  ""The biggest problem I've heard people argue against Kim Jong Il is that it isn't Democratic. North Korea isn't a democracy though? North Korea is a dictatorship. It's honestly saddening how many people don't know this""  Do you see the flaw in your logic here?"
No Fallacy	Actually, thousands of years of observations by other cultures that many fail to recognize provide the proof very clearly. Individuals in a population predisposed to atypical traits and self-expression from thier fellow humans are common enough and documented throughout all of human record. People assigned male at birth who take on the mannerisms, roles, habits, and socialization of people assigned female at birth, and are accepted. Native Americans are a good example. The ideal approach is the idea of this post, to bring understanding to an individual level.
No Fallacy	Ew. Dont be like that.  You dont actually have to be vegan to make a major positive impact on the environment or consider the environment with all of your actions.  For example. I work in pollution abatement for a tribal nation.  I eat red meat &lt;1x per month.  Many of the people here hunt their meat, which has a part of our ecosystem (elk, deer, etc).
No Fallacy	Shit is so fucked at the moment that young people, myself included, are starting to think he might be our last chance to avoid the dystopian hell hole that awaits us under current leadership.  I am yet to see anyone put forward much of an argument against Corbyn that doesn't consist of the usual hypocritical 'terrorist sympathiser' bullshit.
No Fallacy	"Weren't slavery and lynchings considered ""traditional and normal"" at one point? You're making the jump from tradition to righteous and I'm missing an intermediary step. Like I'm willing to entertain your viewpoint but saying something is ""not normal or traditional"" doesn't mean it's wrong.   For instance, the guy who first proposed that surgeons should wash their hands before performing surgery was ridiculed by the entire medical community for a belief that was counter to what was normal and traditional. To take it a step further, bathing regularly was once not a common practice for humans but I'd wager you showered this morning. Now, I'm not saying that just because something goes against the cultural grain that it suddenly becomes good but rather that the two are not connected. Just because something has always been that way doesn't make it right or wrong."
No Fallacy	What if it's for religious reasons? Since circumcision is need for the covenent in Judaism. 
No Fallacy	Thats your point of view. I think traditions are sometimes necessary and also useful. 
No Fallacy	"Just because ""we did something for thousands of years"" is a pretty weak argument."
No Fallacy	Lol and Chinese will use the argument China has a 5000 years of history of Chinese medicine. Hence, it must work.
No Fallacy	While I agree that the texting wasn't okay, I think Harris has a point about etiquette norms changing over time that's worth discussing. Thoughts?
No Fallacy	You must be new here.
No Fallacy	"It's called Appeal to tradition (a.k.a. Argumentum ad Antiquitatem) and Appeal to the masses (Argumentum ad populum, and its reversal). Both of them are logical fallacies that sustain no valid arguments unto a formal discussion. Appealing to tradition is generally seen with statements such as ""the old ways"".   And the appealing to the masses regards that a popular opinion is the truth (e.g. ""My Little Pony sucks!""), while its reversal has the belief that a popular opinion is false (e.g. ""You all say My Little Pony is good, therefore it sucks"").   As to why people do this ... well I don't know, I guess it's for recognition. Now as a member of many fandoms I've found it easier to just ignore them, after all, it's just text or in the worst case scenario a pointless webcam rant on youtube.  (Remember people, don't fall into the use of logical fallacies.)"
No Fallacy	>All that, simply for supporting an Act that did no more than codify an aspect of marriage that had been unquestioned in our society for most of its existence indeed, had been unquestioned in virtually all societies for virtually all of human history.   Yeah, and slavery was unquestioned for most of human history too. Does that mean it's okay to continue slavery?   Scalia is a douchebag. 
No Fallacy	"It's silly that the article referred to giving birth in a hospital as the ""traditional"" way that humans have given birth throughout the ages."
No Fallacy	"Using ""tradition"" as an argument.  ""We should not change because we have always done things this way"" or ""This is just how things are in our culture"" is NOT a good reason to prevent progress!!!"
No Fallacy	"""It's part of their culture"" excuses this, but not the other parts of their culture we went in to change? Bullshit.  ""Culture"" is not an excuse for abuse. "
No Fallacy	Big surprise, NDP targeting rural Albertan lifestyle again. More NDP style overreaching rules telling people how to live there life. At the rate Notley is going there will be very little of the Albertan lifestyle left in 3 years.
No Fallacy	"Seems obvious to me too. Surprised how many people came here to say essentially ""But it's TERDITION!"""
No Fallacy	Do any of you self-righteous pricks understand in the slightest capacity how nature works? There are 4.6 BILLION FUCKING YEARS of evolution on this planet across hundreds upon hundreds of millions of species and not a goddamned one of them, with the exception of you idiots, has any problem with killing for food. It's in the DNA of every single creature on this planet, and it's the SOLE FUCKING REASON that either of us exist. Killing for food is 100% acceptable and morally right, and the suffering of the animals involved is fucking irrelevant. Lions don't give a fuck about the screams of a wildebeest as they disembowel it for a dinner. There is nothing, save for your ego, that gives you a reason to act or feel any different.
No Fallacy	I have been seeing this sort of thing a lot lately.  Feminism as an old movement.  Feminism as a movement that is largely accepted.  Feminism as a movement that is heavily invested in politics, money, and power.  Feminism: conservationism.  Since when are any of those things *good* by the eyes of feminism?
No Fallacy	But I've always done it that way...
No Fallacy	It's the way we've always done things is the default answer when defending racism but not wanting to be come across as overtly racist.
No Fallacy	The comments are ridiculous - ranging from people saying that her husband will cheat, that he is pussywhipped, to saying that her dad was secretly heart-broken, to saying tradition is never to be challenged, etc.  I already read frontpage reddit... I really should not have read the comments!
No Fallacy	Even if britain is a christian nation, he puts forward no reason why it should continue to be. It's stupid that christian prayers are in council meetings that are relevant to the whole community not just the christians.
No Fallacy	"""If an idea is sensible, it will eventually just become part of the accepted wisdom""  I don't really get why this one's so bad, could someone explain it to me?"
No Fallacy	Because that's how we've always done it. 
No Fallacy	Not sure about the god part, but you should probably point out to all those animals eating each other about how silly they're being
No Fallacy	Why do things need to be a 'Chinese proverb'?  Are the Chinese more motivational than 'Random internet dude, 2014'?  I've tried searching for the original Chinese of this and have come up with nothing. Original source is probably reddit.   http://www.reddit.com/r/QuotesPorn/comments/1ncsgf/the_best_time_to_plant_a_tree_chinese_proverb/  Sorry, I just had to tell people. :)
No Fallacy	Which, given the past winners, is a great argument for Assange winning.
No Fallacy	"Paleo always seemed a bit too... woo... to me... keto has hard science but what does paleo have?  Can someone explain it to me?  I just don't get it, it seems arbitrary, like ""We should eat like our ancestors because.... new things are bad!!"".  Or like the only reason it works is because it encourages people away from processed foods full of sugar and flour.  But having random arbitrary rules for your diet based on its similarity to what a caveman ate doesn't really make sense to me.  If the problem is sugar and flour, cut sugar and flour, don't make up a diet for it and impose arbitrary rules based on some other stuff that HAPPENS to cut sugar and flour.  I don't mean any offense.  I just don't understand it."
No Fallacy	Feminism has been around for 200 years?  Well gosh, it must be correct, then.
No Fallacy	"""Here are my quack ideas"" <- Not interesting  ""For some reason, the quack ideas of these people have stuck around and we still have record of them"" <- Interesting  Even for a Charismatic, that can't bee too much to follow. ;)"
No Fallacy	Unfortunately it's a needlessly crass and confrontational comment which was always going to cause this kind of mindless response which shows he's unsuitable for the role he was up for.   It's important to challenge religion but doing so in this manner can only devolve it into a shouting match that will achieve nothing.   Also in the UK there is no separation of church and state as the church is part of the state.   The history of Cambridge university is also intrinsically linked with organised religion. Homerton was set up to originally to educate Calvinist ministers, Trinity is named for the holy trinity, Peterhouse was founded by a Benedictine Monk and is named for the apostle Peter.   I'd be more surprised if you found any part of the university that has always been completely secular.
No Fallacy	I hate to be that guy but Achkchyually anarcho primitivism states we need to view modern society through a synthesis lens based on what our ancestors did better to create a better world, it's no explicit Luddite-ism or claims the people of old were anarchists.
No Fallacy	He hasnt not been a cuck 
No Fallacy	You're definitely asking in good faith.
No Fallacy	"""If you don't support _______ then you hate ______""   Or the inverse   ""If you support ______ then you hate ______""  Like, it just feels like everything HAS TO BE so black and white and has to be entirely justified and it is getting exhausting."
No Fallacy	I play both sides is beginning to sound like Im not racist but...
No Fallacy	"A significant portion of the studies he cites as evidence for ""plant-based"" diets are comparing short to mid-term health effects of these diets with people who are eating an entirely unrestricted, SAD-style diet.  It's not surprising that cutting out a lot of junk food has a lot of health benefits short-term. It does not mean that this translates into a diet that's healthier than other healthy ways of eating, and most people who aren't indoctrinated by vegan propaganda have concerns about the lack of of bioavailable nutrients (particularly fat soluble vitamins and proteins) on a WFPB diet.   It also does not follow that the reason that a junk-food diet shows worse short-term results than WFPB is that the junk-food diet contains more meat. It so happens that the junk food diet contains more junk-food...that's the real problem. Yet somehow Greger will always blame the meat."
No Fallacy	&gt;Being against the CoC means you want women, LGBTQIA+, and People of Color to be harassed.    Standard SJW tactic number 1: agree with us unquestionably or you're guilty of every evil we invent.

No Fallacy	Yeah, Antifa are terrorists. They are responsible for the majority of terrorist attacks and shootings in the US. One event that I can easily recall is when the drove a car into protesters in the Unite the Right rally and killed someone. Oh wait
No Fallacy	Can you elaborate yourself a little bit?
No Fallacy	You don't have to think all cops are bad in order to not trust any cop. Consider if you have the choice to choose to open one of ten boxes. Seven of the boxes contain delicious apple juice, and three of them will release a poison gas that instantly kills you when you open it. With that in mind, do you really want to open a box?
No Fallacy	How is it horsebleep, because it's not your political ideology? Why don't you debunk the actual content then?

No Fallacy	It's astounding to me how many times I see the same insults and attacks in the face of evidence from a side that is not your own. Is it seriously only people you agree with and then fascists?
No Fallacy	TL;DR: Don't bother.  Honestly, you probably don't even want a SLOG. You always have a ZIL, it is just either on the pool or the SLOG. Unless your work load has enough `sync` to cause slow downs, it isn't going to help. And if you *do*, you can achieve the same thing w/ `sync=disabled` on that dataset. If your in flight writes are *so important* that you can't do that, then you should be using a *mirrored* SLOG *and* it should be power fail safe *and* it should be fast at writes. It'll only get read in the case of an oh shit, so read speed doesn't matter. Most people think SLOG is a write cache, but it isn't. It is just a place for `sync` writes to live in case the system fails before that `sync` data in memory can be written to the pool as part of a normal flush.  The article [ZFS sync/async + ZIL/SLOG, explained](https://jrs-s.net/2019/05/02/zfs-sync-async-zil-slog/) by /u/mercenary_sysadmin is a good read about SLOG.
No Fallacy	"Lmao!!! Libertarians be all = ""everyone else is slaughtering people so whats the problem?""  Also libertarians = ""stepping on my lawn violates the NAP""  Yes folks, libertarians are this dumb and immoral...."
No Fallacy	&gt;Your dripping with sarcasm and logical fallacies and refuse to discuss [a CIA psy-op disguised as] other peoples views.  FTFY.  By the way, which logical fallacies am I displaying?   I'm just pointing out that Russiagaters obviously don't belong here since they actually buy the MSM false reality hook, line, and sinker while supporting a swamp creature that helped cover up 9/11.  Are you saying that behavior makes sense?
No Fallacy	Yeah, fucking capitalism. I for one, say we should just follow in the footsteps of communist leader Joseph Stalin! People can't be hungry when they are dead.
No Fallacy	I have a question for everyone out of curiousity.  Let assume it was temple land originally but later Mosque was built on it. Let's also assume Mosque was never destroyed in first place.  Now my question is, is it fair to destroy Mosque in cases like this to build a temple? If Mosque was already there, would supreme court had made the same decision and gave green light to destruction of it to build a temple?  ---  This Mosque was illegally destroyed so the ruling should assume that Mosque is already there. Otherwise this is a loop hole in law. We can just destroy any place beforehand illegally and then go to court to get a favourable judgement.
No Fallacy	this sub as 15k subs and this post has 10k score, The_d has almost 400k subs and doesnt break 10k all that often, this garbage is 100% paid for. 
No Fallacy	Honestly, 90% of this thread is absurd. I'm placing my comment here to explain why to everyone who comes in.  We have several premises:  **P1:** Jesus existed and is also God  **P2:** God exists  **P3:** Jesus believed in God (himself) and everything the Bible claims God (he) did. _______________  If we are taking those premises, then we also must accept the following conclusions:  **C1:** If God exists, then he did create the Earth in 6 days.  **C2:** Therefore, Jesus is perfect and self-consistent.  What you *should* be arguing against is either the existence of God, OR the premise/conclusion that he created the earth in 6 days. Whether Jesus is perfect is irrelevant if you have already asserted that he is the son of God. Ultimately, these two premises cannot co-exist:  **P1:** Human knowledge is perfect/complete in its understanding that the earth was not created in 6 days  **P2:** The Christian God/Jesus is real

No Fallacy	You aren't with it, you are against it.   i.e. : If you don't support Donald Trump you love Hillary.
No Fallacy	"> I must admit that the religious radicals were right in warning us.  You have heard the phrase about a broken clock being right twice a day, right?  Religious radicals were using the slippery slope, *""if things become somewhat different, then they can only be 100% different""*. It is an incredibly black&white mentality, where you have ""decency"" on one side, and *""absolute degeneracy""* on the other.  But that's not the right set of mind. As a matter of facts, the problem is that SJWs adopted the **exact same black&white mentality**, just mirrored. You have *""brave+progressive""* on  one side, and *""biggoted, -ist, -phobic""* on the other. So an unusual trans model being accepted on magazines? That's *""brave+progressive""*, and if you dislike that, you are *""bigoted and transphobic""*. (despite being a minor being sexuality exploited)"
No Fallacy	This is my problem, I fall somewhere in the middle, but that's not even an option anymore. I either have to support the entire gamut on one side or another otherwise both sides say gtfo, then they wonder why people stay home on election day 
No Fallacy	It's like a modern day Dickens novel.
No Fallacy	"Standard Trump-speak...  ""If you don't agree with what I say, you must therefore believe the polar opposite.""  There is no in between position."

No Fallacy	IMO i don't think the fact that the political system of the US is corrupt and very flawed is proof that Socialism is the answer.
No Fallacy	She did no such thing. Get out of here with your divisive bullshit.
No Fallacy	This isn't about Biden vs Sanders anymore, this is about Biden vs Trump. Anyone supposed democrat still pushing this anti-Biden agenda are just GOP/Russian astroturfers or genuine morons.
No Fallacy	There may be several plausible explanations for the same situation. Not everything is black or white. Context and perspective can change everything.
No Fallacy	Reddit also has an obsession with calling out logical fallacies. 
No Fallacy	> One of the most dishonest and ridiculous positions in modern philosophy is that one can lack a belief in something without believing the opposite to be more likely.   Great so are there an even or odd number of gumballs in the jar on my desk? Is it an even number? If you lack belief in that it is even, you must think its more likely that its odd then.  Clearly, this is flawed.  As for your question, I believe there are no fire breathing unicorns. I don't get the point. It seems to me that god is in the same category as these unicorns. 
No Fallacy	I've heard this argument before, and honestly- people who think you can't care about both human rights AND animal rights seem extremely limited. Why does it have to be one over the other? Why do you only have the capacity to care about one issue, and why does your limited capacity prevent you from believing I have the capacity for both?
No Fallacy	Dude facebook steals data on both ios and android
No Fallacy	This is the left, people, this is exactly what the left looks like.
No Fallacy	(tips fedora)  Being atheist myself, I can tell you your logic is kinda flawed. Simply put, a lack of proof is not proof of lack.
No Fallacy	zerohedge.com doesn't care about the people of Flint, but is willing to run with any story that promotes the anti-government story line.    We know how those private corporations like Monsanto feeding you glyphosate are only interested in your well being. 
No Fallacy	The problem is this just increases cost for the customer.  Would you rather spend ~$10/mo for everything, or $10 for netflix + $10 for disney + $10 for anime + $10 for something else, per month?
No Fallacy	&gt; name a billionaire who boosted the productivity more than the government-funded internet  Uhhh, Bill Gates, Sundar Pichai, Steve Jobs, and all the others who made government-funded internet a thing people want in the first place?
No Fallacy	"This whole ""PC = treating people with respect"" thing is a massive [False Equivalence Fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_equivalence) that has gone way too far.  If PC truly is about respect for others, then why do PC advocates show such disrespect for people who disagree with them?"
No Fallacy	"That's ridiculous. No one is ""pro-misogyny"" because that's stupid. We are pro-""not telling people what they can and can't talk about"""
No Fallacy	It's worth noting that the US population is very much larger than both the UK and Canada combined. Of course universal healthcare is a great idea, but you have to consider that implimenting it in a functional way is going to be much more difficult than in smaller countries. 
No Fallacy	> we get the hyper-medicated fiasco of the psychology field, which likes to fix the world's problems by tweaking neurotransmitters in the brain.  are you alleging that the currently prescribed psycho pharmacopeia does, on the whole, more harm than good?  That we'd be better off without all of them?
No Fallacy	> If a parent doesn't feed their kid fast food and just lets them starve  It is called the [Law of excluded middle.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_excluded_middle)
No Fallacy	Binaryism (new word, just made it) has always been a little wierd to me, because I can't really think of anything natural that's actually binary. Like, there's always something that makes it so the binary isn't strictly true.
No Fallacy	That is called Pascal's Wager
No Fallacy	Cancer from the comments -   >Why should she? Like others in her bloodline, she has succeeded while others have failed. That's how the free market works, rewarding those who excel and punishing those who fail. It's all about not only the birth lottery but also personal motivation, aggressiveness, intelligence and yes, looks. The alternative is communism.
No Fallacy	As always, the key is moderation. A little sugar and a little fat is good. We used to say you need no fat and a lot of sugar. Now we say you need no sugar and a lot of fat. Neither is good for you.
No Fallacy	Crazy false dichotomy here.
No Fallacy	None, its just a meme between the alt left and the alt right division vs Yangs forward vision
