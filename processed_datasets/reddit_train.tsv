Slippery Slope	The problem with this approach if taken too far is that by the time those 5th graders reach my college class they believe the whole world revolves around them.  Sadly, it doesnt.  Far better to find out and address whats between those 5th graders getting their work done on time.
Slippery Slope	Who would think that once a religious group got a foot in the door of the public school (as a physical fitness program),  ...... that they would illegally use that opportunity to spiritually proselytize?  /s
Slippery Slope	"ok but can I just say - no his doesn't sound familiar.  The left is asking for expanding background checks, closing the gun show loop hole, maybe registering firearms and creating a system that addresses or catches strawman purchases.   We don't need to play this strawman argument game.  And we don't need to do the ""slippery slope"" thing either.  Reasonable regulations doesn't lead to the fed keeping lists and someday coming after all gun owners to suppress the working class."
Slippery Slope	"Well, yeah.   But the issue I have with it is not really the guns themselves. It's the actual removal of Constitutional Right. Remove one and they will keep going.   They love to bring out the ""Slippery Slope isn't real"" argument, though. While having absolute evidence of the contrary. Another argument they love to bring out is ""Yeah but they already amended the Constitution with the Prohibition!"".   It's a bit infuriating."
Slippery Slope	Yall do realize they are seizing private property, right? The rabbit hole that this leads down and the near blindness everyone seems to have here is fuckin staggering.
Slippery Slope	"the slow process of mask slipping:  ""actually i'm a ""paleoconservative"", i just think that modern conservatives are too supportive of israel  ""and they spend too much time trying to prove they aren't racist when they won't stand up for white people  ""and REAL conservatives don't accept lgbt people   ""and the holocaust was clearly overstated"
Slippery Slope	So... where are you going with this? First Weed. Now Legalise this?
Slippery Slope	I wonder how long until pedophilia is legal.
Slippery Slope	Having sex with children was the norm for thousands of years. There are just enough people in power now who know that shit's disgusting and wrong. But it seems to me to be a common enough thread throughout history to hardly be called a disease or anything. And saying these people need mental help would *absolutely* just have whataboutists start talking conversion therapy for *actual* GSRM folks.  How about pedophiles just don't fucking rape little kids? It's not god damn fucking hard to not rape people, or support child traffickers, or cp proliferators.
Slippery Slope	"You know the day we start giving people sentences based on ""What other people got,"" you're going to find some stupid shit happening.  You know people have gotten away with murder, right?  Kind of a slope of idiocy you're preparing to sled down."
Slippery Slope	The very foundation of this persons belief is that, if we dont discourage homosexuality, the entirety of the human race will eventually become homosexual leading to a breakdown of society and the extinction of the human race.  Why the FUCK would anyone ever think that literally EVERYONE is going to eventually become LGBTQ+?  Thats this persons fear.  What the actual fuck?
Slippery Slope	Censorship always starts with something most people agree with.  Thats how you get buy in.
Slippery Slope	If we start going after tankies then people will see it as an excuse to purge SocDems and even DemSocs, then we'll lose all of our momentum. This has been the fate of all big leftist political movements in the west for the last fifty years.   Resist the urge to antagonize any part of the left for the time being. That can come after we actually accomplish something.
Slippery Slope	and this is how it begins  we should come up with some kind of social credit system too, where if you don't comply to the hysterical mob, you will have no feasible existence in this world, that'll show 'em
Slippery Slope	It's never enough. It'll be 23 hours. And then, why can't it be 20, or 22 hours. And then why not 12 hours. Never enough.
Slippery Slope	Ive mentioned this more than once in conversations. Its the same process every time standards change.  1. ______ should be acceptable because they cant help it/have a disease/were born like this. 2. Now that ______ is acceptable, ______ will be next. 3. Ill never except _____! Its wrong!  Then you repeat steps 1 - 3.   Personally I think anyone that has harmed a child should be publicly castrated, but thats just my opinion. Id bet money in the next few years there will be a big push against pedophiliaphobe, and if you cant accept them for who they are youre a bigot, blah blah blah.
Slippery Slope	We need to legalize meth next!
Slippery Slope	"I'd say nah because there's a huge grey area. ""oh so definitely we're taxing butter. White bread definitely, yeah the nice artisan French bread is included under that umbrella. All condiments we'll tax, ketchup is sugar and mayo is oil. Pickles too yeah, they're just pure sodium."" Etc."
Slippery Slope	Soon it will be those over 70 then over 60 etc.  Once you cross the line, its all downhill from there
Slippery Slope	The problem with testing is that it's probably left to the states to implement, and they can make it *de facto* impossible to pass (or possibly even sit the exam), or worse, allow preferential treatment/make it prohibitively expensive to accomplish and therefore accomplish a gun ban.  For example, let's say there's a class, but there's 10 people in the entire state (Let's say, California) that are allowed to teach the class, it takes two weeks, and you can't teach more than 50 people at time. Also, it costs $800 to take, meaning you lock out a lot of people that can't afford.
Slippery Slope	If south Europe Falls The north falls too
Slippery Slope	I use searches so I can't be accused of cherry picking.  This is all you have, why did you bother?
Slippery Slope	Do you think CPD will let us decorate our stars of David patches they inevitably use to categorize drug buyers? Pardon if this offensive comparison is too much. I'm a strong believer that it's only a slippery slope away from my extreme comparison.
Slippery Slope	"This is the equivalent of ""if we let gays marry, what's to stop people from marrying their dog?"" Were smarter than that arnt we?"
Slippery Slope	Using one handers is not the same as transmogging into one handers. If they'll do it, then everybody else will start to demand anything. Swords into wands, wands into fist weapons and it will become clownfiesta, where cloth classes will look like fury warriors.
Slippery Slope	That still sets a dangerous precedent though. If spells work, maybe alternative medicine does too? Who needs vaccines when we have snake oil? We should never promote stupidity. It only leads to further harm.
Slippery Slope	No you didn't?  It is literally an item handed to you by claptrap while following the DLC2 main story quest line.  You can farm it by resetting your playthrough and running through the DLC again, that is the only way to get it.  Or you can savescum your save file to farm it, but that is a slippery slope to me down the path of modding gear and cheating, so I don't do it.
Slippery Slope	I called it years ago as lgbt rights were being established. Next is having relationships with your pets. Those that think no way, its already brewing in the background.
Slippery Slope	Why are they always pushing for mor and more degeneracy all the time. First they have gay acceptance marriage, then the troomers start popping up, then we get idiots who wear mascot outfits and fuck animals, then we get sweaty neckbeards who have anime profile pics and sexualize children, and now they want us to date and marry people who are loaded with diseases and fuck other people.
Slippery Slope	A total gun ban doesnt happen over night. It happens by chipping away at the 2nd amendment until theres nothing left. Small iterations seem like nothing at the time (especially to those who dont care about guns), but the fact is that gun rights are much weaker than they were 25 years ago.
Slippery Slope	If we blame parents for their children becoming serial killers, why stop there? DUI? Blame the parents for creating an alcoholic child. Bank robber? Blame the parents for not instilling values in their child. Wife beater? Best get those parents on trial for not teaching their child how to treat women.  I don't see that as being the answer.
Slippery Slope	Its a slippery slope. Next theyll be raiding your house because you have to much food. Then theyll need your ammo and guns.
Slippery Slope	I agree. This is an incredibly slippery slope and very dangerous line of thinking that could do significantly more harm than good. I understand what hes talking about in the video but I cant say I agree with him due to the way it could be abused
Slippery Slope	Probably violating some kind of governors order or law about price gouging and not having a license or something. He didnt hoard them for himself and probably got caught trying to sell them.
Slippery Slope	And those 2 people will go home to their families of 1, 2, 3 whatever. Then if these 2 are ignoring the rules, they are probably too. Now they're going to their friends houses. Then they're going to their friends houses.  Now just 2 people together means hundreds have come into contact with one another
Slippery Slope	Yup. That is pretty fucking disgusting I agree . That's like almost a porn ad in public space.
Slippery Slope	Oh you are so selfish, I think we should also demand free snacks and food as a worker's right, oh, what else, umm, I'd also like 2-day workweek but the salary should stay the same or increase, also if we want to live in a civilized world, every worker should have a right to demand his/her favorite food for free from the employer every single day, in my case it's [Lobiani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobiani)
Slippery Slope	 This is what's wrong with you. Spreading your agenda of cross-dressing next in line we will get your comics where you encourage hormone altering injections.     Edit: I encourage you to raise your kid in such a weird manner. Anyway your comics have little impact in my country (i hope). So I don't care whether or not you make western men weak
Slippery Slope	I can see how this is a touchy subject.  Regardless of what you hear there are risks to vaccinations. They are incredibly rare though and in my opinion, it is worth the vaccination.   The problem is being forced into this. Should we force child limits if the population grows too fast?  Should people with a genetic predisposition to violence be allowed to have children or should they be sterilized to protect the majority?  I dont have kids and dont know how I would feel about this kind of requirement.   As a single person with no kids I would obviously prefer to have all children vaccinated so that I dont get sick :)
Slippery Slope	I would like it on a handheld. If only Sony didnt stop productions and creations of handheld devices. Switch is the next best thing I guess but I dont want it for Switch. People act so crazy over it and a person I saw online actually sent a death threat in a mountain of curses demanding P5 be for Switch. Im not up for giving someone what they want if they act like that. Their attitudes would get worse if you give into their demands.
Slippery Slope	Fine and great, but just wait until the government requires citizens to take mandatory anti-depressants, so everyone is safer against suicidal terrorist attacks. Don't think it'll ever happen? Well no one would have thought mandatory vaccinations (or any other medical procedure) would be forced on citizens by the state either. This sets a worrying precedent, even if it's mostly a good idea....
Slippery Slope	No guys you dont understand. Communism is just what happens when they take socialism too far. Bernie is totally gonna stop at just the right amount of socialism. Just like they stopped at background checks for firearm purchases, and same sex marriage. And border control. And pretty much every single thing theyve ever done. Sorry, but any time theyre given an inch, they take a mile. Im not giving any more ground to the left.
Slippery Slope	nobody is arguing its not effective. people are arguing that this is an attempt to increase government control and that this is just the beginning. of course many people will agree with this because its about children. but tomorrow it will be about your neighbour who was deemed by the government to be a domestic terrorist because he dared criticize the government, and it will be your job to report him and if you dont, you will be punished
Slippery Slope	"2014: ""Bake that cake!""  2019: ""Wax those balls!""  2020: ""Date that psycho!"""
Slippery Slope	"""Collecting the genetic blueprints of people in immigration detention doesn't make us safer  it makes it easier for the government to attack immigrant communities, and brings us one step closer to the government knocking on all of our doors demanding our DNA under the same flawed justification that we may one day commit a crime,"" Naureen Shah, senior advocacy and policy counsel with the ACLU said in a statement.  Yea that sounds kinda dangerous to limited government"
Slippery Slope	Because it can easily encourage mass hysteria if hundreds of people are trying to suddenly stock up on toilet paper or canned beans or whatever. People are going to be encouraged to go out and buy shit before its all gone.
Slippery Slope	It is a process. Restrict one civil liberty, restrict all civil liberties. Look up the first they came poem, that perfectly entails in situation.
Slippery Slope	R/childfree started as a support group for people being pressured by family to have kids.   It has turned into another hate group.   They hate kids and people who have kids.   And its getting worse.   It wont be long before they will start encouraging violence against kids, if they havent already.
Slippery Slope	"The rational explanation is it's a very personal matter of women's health, and it leads to slippery slope territory when men, who are not medical professionals, try to ""track"" what's going on with our bodies."
Slippery Slope	&gt;If we ban a card that impacts only a small number of players, what will those players ask for next?   This is a valid concern but I've never seen the cEDH community ask for a ban before. They'll question why useless things are banned or wonder what a cEDH driven ban list might look like, but Flash/Hulk/Oracle is the only serious push I've seen for a ban.
Slippery Slope	Restrict free speech?  That may hurt your protests the next time someone hurts your feelings.
Slippery Slope	Cool. In fact, in the interests of being culturally sensitive, maybe I should learn all their words and only use their language when talking with them. I'd only be required to learn a few hundred languages, right?     (Stupidest thing I've read all day).
Slippery Slope	Good for them, pushing sodomy on children is a slippery slope.
Slippery Slope	If he were seeking to display a genuine concern in climate change, he'd find another way. But lets be serious. Climate change is a joke. It's merely a ploy for world government.
Slippery Slope	Why would another grown adult need permission from another grown adult to do something to their own body?   Where does it stop?
Slippery Slope	I guess we should forget about all white heritage. I mean, Sir John A McDonald statues have already been torn down and destroyed... first steps on a very slippery slope... how long before being Caucasian isnt tolerated because pioneers were bad.  White shaming and white guilt is already a daily occurrence thats for some reason accepted, as is racism towards whites.   Lets see how much this gets downvoted.
Slippery Slope	Right so everything else should be free too ? I like the guy but let's be realistic
Slippery Slope	I think you're foolish if you think at this point the Democrats in the establishment are going to play nice if they get the presidency. They've already seen what the Republican party can do with the presidency, why would the corporate entities who control the party want anything to do with normalcy? It is just as likely that they will try and set up their brand of an authoritarian government in the power vacuum that is left behind by Donald Trump's regime.
Slippery Slope	You're forgetting, if you give Liverpool the mathematically uncertain title, then 3-5 start claiming Champions League and Top 2 in Championship claim promotion. Giving 1 thing that is not confirmed at the top is causing a massive snowball affect further down. You either give *everything* or *nothing*
Slippery Slope	&gt; Turns out our scientists are pretty fucking important after all.  *For want of a wage the postdoc was starved;*  *For want of a postdoc the lab was lost;*  *For want of a lab the vaccine was lost;*  *For the failure of vaccine the kingdom was lost*  *All for the want of a livable wage.*
Slippery Slope	There is a progression to these things. Eventually you end up with an entirely non-transparent censorship system suitable for purely political uses.
Slippery Slope	Why stop there?
Slippery Slope	We should do that with personally owned houses. Take them from you and donate them to homeless people. Or at least force you to share living accommodations.  Also - Your food, water, medicine, transportation, toilet paper, toys, money, etc.
Slippery Slope	"It's amazing how accepting all of Reddit is to police and military walking the streets of the entire country to forcibly imprison everyone in their own homes.  Next we'll have damn tanks cruising down residential streets and ya'll will just say ""it's to keep the elderly safe of covid-19, it is worth it""!"
Slippery Slope	She is spreading misinformation. Soon people are gonna do this instead of using real medicine. Thats the harm
Slippery Slope	I dont get it. Should they also be required to sell their businesses if they sit on committees or vote on legislation which will affect them? Maybe we should also make them exempt from paying federal taxes since they write the tax laws.   Should we also pass laws that say state and local government officials cant own property in the areas under their jurisdiction so they cant make property tax or zoning laws which benefit them?
Slippery Slope	I also look forward to when you can bring in infinite ammounts of money into your raid, your character has to shit every 12 hours, your character sleeps at least 8 hours a day or gets a debuff, you lose the game permanently if you die, painkillers and vaseline become obsolete because they don't  actually help when your limbs have literally been shot out, when you have to see your therapist 2 times a week for your PTSD appointments, when they remove levels and skills and your character rolls a random set of skills based on his previous employment and where he went to school, when they  abandon the fantasy world of Tarkov to make way for the real world inspired map: Boise, Idaho.  &amp;#x200B;  Better not complain, adapt to the realistic environment.
Slippery Slope	Then 999 million, 99 million, 9 million, 999,000 etc. will be too much
Slippery Slope	Storage/use of personal data. This has been a big issues in countries like Sweden.
Slippery Slope	That's a great way for us to lose the game all together.
Slippery Slope	See? This is the kind of crap that gets bred from moral relativism. If you believe youre a random assembly of atoms and attraction is a chemical reaction, and that acting on that attraction is just stardust bumping into stardust... then anything goes, eventually. Messed up!!
Slippery Slope	They sound just like those people saying when gay marriage gets legalised theyre going to allow bestiality and incest
Slippery Slope	I don't think it's overkill. It sends the message clearly. They aren't fucking around anymore. Why does this man think he is allowed to surf while most people who are quarantined are stuck inside their homes. What if every quarantined person thought like he did. You would have a problem on your hands.
Slippery Slope	So which other essential employees should be able to walkout on their jobs? Would you be in favor of Drs and Nurses walking out? How about the janitors that clean the hospitals? Should nursing home staff be able to walkout and leave the elderly to die like they did in Spain?  If you live in a city it would mean you rely deeply on essential employees to show up.  Without grocery stores, pharmacies, truckers, cops, firefighters, EMS, paramedics, power/water/sewage employees, sanitation workers, gas stations, UPS, Amazon and Fedex.. the list goes on forever.. we are deeply reliant on these people to continue to show up or we are all fucked.
Slippery Slope	Where do you draw the line? No one has provided a decent way of explaining how fines should be given out. Let's walk down Spadina and fine every homeless person for not self quarantining.   &amp;#x200B;  Jesus Christ
Slippery Slope	&gt; CENSORSHIP  Literally yes it would be. Suppression of communication on the basis that's harmful. That our government is working together with reddit should really be more of a concern.
Slippery Slope	"well is it ""accepting it"" or is it treading the line without crossing it?  moving the line backwards so that these people arent treading the previous line - would lead to people treading that one, so another person like you would make demands to move it backwards - you see where this is going?  there is a reason that line is where it is"
Slippery Slope	Ew no thanks, soon they'll be doing the same with bats and dogs because certain people do it too.
Slippery Slope	"Thank you for this.  It's laughable how often gamers cry about ""oh but what if I only play games like Tetris or Animal Crossing or *insert supposedly non-violent game here*?""  It's like a heroin addict saying ""yeah but I only use FRESH needles, so it's not THAT bad, right??"" The cognitive dissonance required to obtain that jarring lack of self awareness can only be attributed to a brain rotted by videogames."
Slippery Slope	Not going to lie, I'm okay with this.   I'm a leftist. And we need to vote tomorrow.   If today is coronavirus, what will it be tomorrow where they will move an election?    Right now Donald Trump is making policy on some b******* that he sees on Infowars. What will our next governor say in order to move an election?
Slippery Slope	The potential for abuse would be enormous.  It would be like the old Roman grain allotments.  If the UBI is set at $500 a month, then all a politician would have to do to be wildly popular is promise to expand it to $1000.  Then $2000, 3000, 10000.  And you *KNOW* that's exactly what would happen, because, like I said, there's perfect historical precedent.  It's incredibly easy for politicians to bribe the electorate with their own money.
Slippery Slope	If there are no incentives to go out into the open world then it becomes a slippery slope toward all content becoming instanced.  Things like world buffs are the difference between the game being a true MMO; or a co-op dungeon crawler, arena brawler like retail.
Slippery Slope	NTA. You told her the facts then she got upset. I'd have told her to take a hike and see a therapist. Really, if you entertain everybody's discomfort then society eventually breaks down. Sometime the problem is the individual so they need to fix their psychological problem.
Slippery Slope	I'm still against it. If it's not restricted to a man and a women, what's the purpose? Why not make a contract between *n* people who live together.
Slippery Slope	I think it's a free speech issue. Any argument, short of personal insult (because then it's no longer a debate) should be allowed. If we ban one type of argument because you think it's abhorrent, then we have to ban argument type b because someone else is offended. This is a debate sub. We should argue against that sort of thing, not ban it altogether.
Slippery Slope	"""We just wanted to get married"" led to this."
Slippery Slope	That's exactly the road that we went down on after using that reason to justify the LGBT community. The exact same reason can be used to justify pedophilia.
Slippery Slope	Right, while we are at it, remove the 6 portals limitation, remove hardcore mode, also increase base life by 2000%, why not, game is too hard
Slippery Slope	They always need to see how far they can push before it snaps back.  Gay marriage passed?  Lets move on to transgender.  That starts being ok?  Pedophilia becomes the next to be normalized.  So on and so forth until we stop this nonsense.
Slippery Slope	A prime example of the importance of free speech.  &gt; Oh, but we only want to outlaw hate-speech, not free speech. &gt;  &gt; Does hate-speech include insulting the King? &gt;  &gt; Uhh...  EDIT:  If you guys dont think the definition of hate-speech will always be written by the powerful, to favor the powerful, you need to read history.
Slippery Slope	Mass surveillance and tracking of people by mobile data if they have Covid-19? Hard pass.
Slippery Slope	Slippery slope no? Considering the history of disabled people being killed or tortured or tested on or eliminated in Nazi fires or being sterilized or having limited or no rights or not having the right to make their own decision.  You are a stranger to history and science. Stop being one.
Slippery Slope	"i agree with you 100% , but if we keep accepting these ""adjustments"" to every pass then we will be back to the old way it was . the only reason the passes have gotten better is because player base spoke up and thats why we are getting more stuff out of the pass , not out of riot's kind heart"
Slippery Slope	All of these comments about how good it is for non-Chinese gamers... Those people should reconsider their priorities. I don't like hackers in my games either, but I am far more concerned about authoritarian surveillance laws that affect the lives of millions of people and further divide a global community that needs to work together and keep each other accountable for our actions. THAT's the news here. This isn't even a gaming subreddit.   How would you feel if your government took away your right to communicate with Canadians, or Scots, Aussies or maybe people from the neighboring state or province? For fear you might learn how they think, or feel, or act? Put a curfew on when you can access entertainment?   You should stand up for their human rights, even if some of them are jerks, or yours might be next.
Slippery Slope	I would just ask if it's really worth it. The problem we have is that people are trying to find any way possible to find a loophole. You guys playing on an empty field might well be responsible and move on etc but really, it risks encouraging others rather than anything.  I would just say don't bother for now, I get that's crap, but it's unique times and just exercising and keeping moving is also part of our way of respecting the situation we are in rather than trying to beat the system on everything.  Edit: oh dear the selfish squad are down voting again, you must only focus on your every need and ignore what's actually happening.
Slippery Slope	Welfare exists to make people lazy. And when people get lazy, they stop thinking and become sheep. And thats what the Democrats want. Sheep for their big government to dominate. /s
Slippery Slope	Because they were being pieces of shit - and this kind of intolerance is what ultimately leads to deep prejudice  and in lots of cases physically manifests in violence and even genocide. Why the fuck should we allow behavior like that to continue?
Slippery Slope	Ok, lets go along with you and say its unfair to impose these restrictions on 17 year olds. How about 15 year olds, can they drink, smoke and buy guns, how about 13 year olds? Why stop at teenagers, what about 9 year olds who are super mature?  This isnt unpopular, its just ill conceived teenage entitlement.
Slippery Slope	I think they pretty clearly explained that people breaking the rules by using public tennis courts that have been closed, will lead to more extreme measures to keep parks closed.   Theres likely a excusable reason that this many people could be congregating together, the point is, they shouldnt be doing it at a public park thats been closed for health concerns. Even if theyre healthy and fine, breaking the rules leads to a precedent of everyone thinking their a special case and then the rules apply to no one.
Slippery Slope	We don't have total free speech. You can't incite a panic or slander. And hate speech laws in placed like Canada only prevent you from advocating for genocide based on race or gender. Do you have a problem with not advocating for genocide?
Slippery Slope	You have to be very naive to think romantic prefrences does not transfer into other aspects of life.  I'm sorry but someone who would not date Hispanics for example, is also far more likely to not hire them for a high paying job ect. I just don't believe someone can ONLY pick and choose racially as far as romance is concerned and be completely fair in other more important aspects of life.  If you have a romantic prefrence you are more likely to discriminate (pick and choose) in other ways as well
Slippery Slope	Guess what? police need to interact with people at close quarters. they often need to touch or grapple. The masks do little. Cool it. Once they wear masks your anxiety will force you to demand the next step. biohazard suits? get real.
Slippery Slope	Before: Why do you care what we do in our own bedrooms, it doesn't affect you.  Now: Eat the gay food. Use the gay bank. Watch the gay parades. Watch the gay TV shows. Play the gay games. Learn about gay history. Teach your kids about gay sex. Let drag queens read to your children. Let your sons wear dresses and take drugs to alter their biology.
Slippery Slope	Ya the the thing is if we give the government access theyll know they can so they keep taking more and more  Thats one of the arguments against gun laws, if we give them a foot theyll take a mile
Slippery Slope	I don't see the problem. When the government says stay home, stay home. When the government says hands up, hands up. When the government says walk to Oklahoma, walk. When the government says get in the internment camp, get. When the government says get in the boxcar, get. It's for the common good, idiot.
Slippery Slope	Everyone should 100% stay at home... but we also should be real damn careful about how much power we hand over not just to the government but large corporations and social media.  Censorship is a hell of a thing and a lot of really bad shit started with the best intentions.
Slippery Slope	UBI can also be similar to modern slavery though. They can implement a system where you are forced to do certain things in order to get UBI - submit to continuous and invasive surveillance, get national ID cards used for everything, submit to social credit schemes, keep a clean criminal record, etc etc etc. And even if it doesn't start that way, it can easily head that way over 5, 10, 15 years and continue to get worse. In theory it's a great idea, but most of us don't trust the government to regulate itself enough for systems like this to work for the people.
Slippery Slope	Look man the worst things in history were done with the best intentions, Hitler though that he was saving the Germans by killing the Jews, or mau though that by killing the birds he would get more food for his people.   So saying that the government is doing everything for the better of humanity is kinda an oxymoron because government has a poor history of screwing over people.   What makes you think that with these new powers the government wont confiscat guns, or people with a certain ideology, or even people with the virus and put them into camps. But were just saving people, right?
Slippery Slope	&gt;This type of stuff is what gives these nuts saying the lockdown is communism talking points.  Or maybe, just maybe, you might start to see that there's some validity to their concerns.
Slippery Slope	"Yeah, we need to draw the line here. Otherwise it will eventually be 20 early-access cards 2 weeks early, then buying newpacks a month early with $$$... until ""the newest released set is gems-only!"""
Slippery Slope	Pedophilia is a mental disorder/ailment. Just as some would classify homosexuality. Wasn't uncommon to hear homosexuals be called homophiles in older days. Pedophiles are this centuries homosexuals. Widely hated by all, yet 100 years ago the homosexuals would have been hated just as much. Now I'm not one to hate without reason, but you should consider these contrasts. It will provide knowledge on human social structures and insight as to how society changes its direction. In 100 years people will call themselves pedosexuals and to protest would be pedophobic haha.
Slippery Slope	When people say surveillance is a slippery slope, as with other fundamental rights, this is what they're talking about.  This is gut churning.
Slippery Slope	You know how you stop Confederate flags from showing up in Lansing?  You vote out anyone who was elected who displays it, and you shame any non-elected official/private person into changing their actions. Forcing the removal of a single symbol does nothing to address the feelings and thoughts behind it, and if anything, makes it easier to ferret out hate and address it.   This is besides the fact that once you start the b-ball rolling on governmental restrictions on free speech, it is only a matter of time before everyone gets squashed by it.
Slippery Slope	"The following qoute sums up my thoughts rather well;   *""He who fights monsters should see to it that he himself does not become a monster. And if you gaze for long into an abyss, the abyss gazes also into you.""*   Friedrich Nietzsche, Beyond Good and Evil  The means does not always justify the end, no matter how much 'good' the end does."
Slippery Slope	Comments on these always crack me up.  They are making money from us paying for Xbox live gold.  But that isnt enough....they have to plaster ads right on the damn home screen to make even more revenue.  And people are just fine with it.  Go play a game der der der.  So eventually well have an entire home screen full of ads and people will be good with that.  I could see it if you dont have gold, but for Christs sake
Slippery Slope	"Not OP but there is a slippery slope argument that genetic modifications will lead to new age eugenics. Removing Huntington disease is one thing, but it's not difficult to see how some might use it to remove what they consider ""inferior"" traits.  Ther is also the fear that since distribution of technology typically is made to rich and affluent first, a generation of rich ""superhumans"" (for lack of a better term) would be born before he technology becomes available to society at large."
Slippery Slope	Im for it, but the thing is i think ppl womt like it because where would we stop? First to cure diseases, then it might be to choose apperance and strenghts  Althou im all for it i understand why others might not
Slippery Slope	"Reading everyone's comments has made me change my opinion on having an adventure mode like thing in PoE. I keep seeing if an adventure mode needs to exist then why not just start a char at 68. then a couple months after that we'll see post about how people want to start at 90 just so they can kill bosses. Then a few months later we'll see people asking for a ""creative"" mode so they can have access to all items in the game so they don't have to farm, and i dont think that sets a good example as a community for a game that we all love."
Slippery Slope	Why stop there?  I could just as easily argue that the existence of millionaires and thousandaires is a policy failure.  But praytell, just what policy by a legit political party, ie not the Commies or the Furries or whatever are you referring to?
Slippery Slope	Exactly this. They pay so little because water itself is free. Turning water into a commodity is a very slippery slope. Better to just stop buying the bottled water and let Nestle do its thing.      How can people think paying for oxygen is some dystopian nightmare but still campaign for Nestle to pay for the water they pump is crazy to me. Can you imagine seeing the value of water per litre being displayed next to things like gold, silver, and oil?
Slippery Slope	Distracted driving is a HUGE problem but the fact that people are begging for a state run mass surveillance system is terrifying. It may seem innocuous and even helpful at first but the implications are tremendous. These are the first steps towards mass facial recognition and social credit systems... and people are clamoring for it. Its crazy.
Slippery Slope	"If you allow complex bans, you can 'complex ban' almost anything from any tier, with no real clear limit. If ""Aegislash is Ubers but without king's shield it is OU"" is possible, why not ""Zacian is Ubers but without these X moves it's OU""? Tiers would cease to really mean anything: the only difference between tiers would be the arbitrary line where mons can be ran as they are.  Additionally, banning debates would get an additional layer of complexity, as they're no longer about *whether* to ban but *what* to ban. If corviknight is overpowered, can we best balance it by removing its ability to run pressure? Bulk up? Substitute?"
Slippery Slope	"Great idea on the quick chats but paying for it only opens the gates for more useful add ons to have a price which potentially turns this game into a pay to win kinda thing. I only say that because I think this idea would be a strategic game changer. Kickoffs would be more predictable for the teammate with more options to access the situation. They should just throw these in the game.   Also in addition to your highly impressive list of quick chats, they should add a third button to be pressed before making a quick chat. Not sure if that's the best way to explain it but, instead of pressing up up for ""Nice one!"" press up three times. That would allow for more options a player has for chat. Probably too many options but it's not a polished idea yet."
Slippery Slope	First it's explosives and other tactical tools.  Then it's full auto and selective burst firing.  Then it's semi-auto rifles.  Then all guns are banned.  It's a slippery slope.
Slippery Slope	Sexualising young children (children beauty paegents) should be legal then? Why not include child porn while you're at it...
Slippery Slope	Very sad to see Virginia starting down the path to authoritarianism. Not good.
Slippery Slope	Yeah, he seems like a fairly rational guy but Im not a fan of UBI. After thats in place, every president will claim theyre going to increase it 10%, 50% 300% vote for me free money. Once its part of the economy theres no going back. You cant remove a thousand dollars a month from people.
Slippery Slope	Maybe they could also have the enemies kill themselves in exterminate missions by default,  and maybe make it to where we don't have to level anything,  all frames and all mods just start at max level by default.
Slippery Slope	"This is cool and all, but I'm glad it's not being passed in a country where I live.  If you give the government *any* control over what is considered ""hate speech"", you are basically relinquishing your freedom of speech. It's a slippery slope.  For example: saying ""hateful"" things about Islam becomes illegal. Let's say you criticise Sharia laws (laws based off of the rules set out in Islam for those who are unaware). Next thing you know, your own government has full power to censor this ""hate"", and you are persecuted simply for disagreeing with the laws of an ally nation.  Governments have shown time and time again that they are more than happy to censor and abuse their peoples. Don't ever relinquish your freedoms willingly."
Slippery Slope	yeah. Right now it may not be much, but the horse armor wasnt also much. Now we have to pay for every unfinished game and for the DLC to complete it.   You can downvote me also for an opinion kids, but I quote you when we have to pay for every mon and every arena in 3 years. Its not about having money or not, its about paying for features that should be included.
Slippery Slope	whew, now we just call anyone we don't like a nazi and we can genocide them     woah there buddy, are you enjoying movies by primarily white actors... you know what that makes you...
Slippery Slope	If this strike violates the terms of your existing labor contract, why would you expect the administration to even negotiate a new one with you? Its been shown you won't honor a contract that both parties signed in good faith. Why would UC trust you not to just strike again, for whatever reasons you deem fit, the minute the ink on the new one is dry?
Slippery Slope	"yeah, and all that is great until the ""wealth tax"" gets extended to the middle-class  just like the income tax was  be careful what you wish for"
Slippery Slope	Remember when bungie first added eververse in D1 and everyone freaked out but we where told that eververse was only there for bungie to make abit of side cash while they worked on dlcs, and everyone then told the people that freaked out that they where overreacting? Well this is why everone that freaked out freaked out, because it always starts off slow but after afew years it becomes the main focus of the game, sadly now we are at a point where bungie don't care how much we complain as long as the money keeps on flowing in they won't change a thing.
Slippery Slope	From a libertarian perspective, I'm opposed to any government mandated medical procedure.  Even a harmless or beneficial procedure may be starting us down a slippery slope.  In practice, I think government mandated vaccines are a net positive.  We're probably not going down that slippery slope, so I'm fine with not letting some facebook mom group bring back polio.
Slippery Slope	Funny how after they regulated seat direct ammo sales all of a sudden they can impose new laws.
Slippery Slope	"Legitimate issue with Sanders. Hard to believe European social democrats would have nice things to say about Fidel Castro. Sanders really is hard-left, not just regular left.  Sanders line of arguing here is a slippery slope. Need more examples to illustrate how slippery it is?  ""Hitler built the Autobahn. Is that a bad thing? It's an amazing road network, and so fun to drive""  ""Nazis sucked, but their uniforms were hot""  ""The Soviet Union was brutal, but hey, at least everyone had a job""  ""Sure China is a dictatorship, but they've had so much economic success""  &#x200B;  It is a classic move to defend the indefensible.  &#x200B;  Sometimes, even HW is worth quoting. He said:  ""We know what works. Freedom Works. We know what's right. Freedom is right.""  compare that to   ""Yea, but they have a literacy program ..."""
Slippery Slope	A little bit of gun control here,  another 15% tax,  A little bit of a reform to make it so you cant sell firearms inside of city limits.   what part of shall not be infringed arent ya getting?  enforce the laws that exist, hold domestic abusers accountable, provide mental health care. close the private sales loophole on background checks.
Slippery Slope	People dont get that censoring something that is unacceptable in like 1/3 of the world is opening flood gates to censoring everything a large group of people hate... which would pretty much delete all kind of expression both good and bad.
Slippery Slope	And the worst part is, he will get caught, he will suffer consequences for it, and it wont deter him, it will only push him to commit increasingly risky crimes. This is how a career criminal gets their start, thinking theyre smarter than everyone else and like theyre beating the system. I knew a bakers dozen kids like him growing up, and Id say half of them are serving life sentences.     Shoplifting -> commercial burglary -> residential burglary -> robbery -> armed robbery -> murder
Slippery Slope	Sure.  In fact, that other guy is probably more romantic than you anyways.  Let him take your wife on a 2 week vacation while he dicks her down.  And he's more of an alpha male than you anyways, so go ahead and let him raise the kids.  He's probably better at work so quit and let him take your job.  Since you're an inferior male, you should probably save all that food for the alphas so they can stay strong.  They could use your room too.   World oxygen is at a decline so you should probably stop breathing since betas shouldn't breed anyways.
Slippery Slope	You have to sleep in order to function at work, so why not ask them to pay you rent while you are at it?
Slippery Slope	If we start including things that aren't orientations or gender identities, there's no way to stop the pedos claiming they're covered too.
Slippery Slope	The perp's poems weren't even scheduled to be part of the proceedings. Stop forwarding a false narrative.  The anthology in question was years ago, and all this professor did was curate the collection and select the poems on quality. The perp's poems were just two out of 50+ poems in the anthology. The professor didn't commit the crime, wasn't involved in the crime, doesn't condone the crime, and has clearly been speaking on this topic for years.  How far does the guilt smearing go? Are we going to interfere with events on campus sponsored by local Hispanic students because the perp now lives in Mexico, and we cannot stomach that the Mexican government is allowing him to exist and work? How many degrees of separation do we need before we can be safe from being Cancelled  by the censorious mob?
Slippery Slope	Give an inch and theyll take a mile

Slippery Slope	"it will be moved from being ""opt in"" to ""opt out"" to ""free for all"" with time. The ""voluntary"" part is just the trojan horse, don't fool yourself."
Slippery Slope	Yeah, I may get shit on here for this, but I think it's a gross violation to take away somebody's constitutional right over a misdemeanor. I hope this goes all the way to the supreme court and gets shut down immediately.  A DUI has nothing to do with guns. It's clear they're trying to get around the constitution to implement gun control any way possible.  If you support this remember one thing. This about more than just guns. If they can take away a CONSTITUTIONAL right for a fucking MISDEMEANOR, well. They could take away just about anything after that becomes a precedent.
Slippery Slope	Sets bad precedent, tommorow future govts could do the same to opposition
Slippery Slope	Why doesnt everyone contribute 100% of everything they make and everything they have to taxes. From there the government can fund all of the social programs we need and then distribute out the necessities of life according to what each individual person needs. Stupid conservatives.
Slippery Slope	Gays led to trannys. Look at where we are now since we didnt stand up to gays.
Slippery Slope	We said it was a slippery slope and now we're falling further into degeneracy
Slippery Slope	">This is wrong. Pedophiles do not choose to be attracted to children. That's a fact. As long as they do not hurt a child (or promote/support doing so ie: child porn) they have done nothing wrong and deserve no condemnation.  **Ohhh another pedo sympathizer...**   >Guys, this is r/TumblrInAction, I really thought we were beyond ""thoughtcrime"".  When is about silly shit yeah... When is about grown men wanting to fuck kids but restraining themselves, well, thats another matter.   >You don't need to hunt them down to protect the children. Reasonable restrictions, therapy and a watchful adult are enough. Not wanting to kill them for what they think/feel is NOT a slippery slope, it's basic decency.  It is a slippery slope. You stop watching that guy for a minute and he will ruin the live of someone just because ""it's basic decency"".  **There are lines you don't cross.**"

Irrelevant Authority	The Kaaba has a similar function to idols in that it serves as material object used for worshipping a deity, the main difference being that idols represent the deity while Kaaba does not.  Furthermore it is helpful to keep in mind that Abraham as far as historians is concerned didnt exist as an actual historical figure, so to claim the Kaaba was built by him carries with it two unsubstantiated claims.

Huh another obviously very intelligent expert, if what you're saying is correct then all the smart people voted for Clinton.   &gt;Ruth Ben-Ghiat, a historian at New York University who's an expert on authoritarianism  What, another historian who's an expert on authoritarianism. So many smart people.   Imagine being terrified of experts and scientists, professors, doctors etc like Trump supporters are."
Irrelevant Authority	"Really good question - as the person in the OP I'd love to clarify, speaking from my own field (critical rhetoric, academic debating, cognitive theory , ethics) feminism has transformed how theory-making is done. This is true in the ""hard sciences"" too, per the many many academic friends I have. For context, I've coached national championship winning debate programs, 5 national championship finalist debaters, and taught in higher education (public university systems) across 5 states and 15 years.      The long and the short of it is, if you are operating in an intellectual space and not engaging feminist critical perspectives then you are doing stone-aged theory and can't get too upset if you're ignored."
Irrelevant Authority	Yeah let's take your word for it.. a Reddit warrior with no actual competitive experience against pros.. lmao
Irrelevant Authority	Good ol' race baiting. Gotta love how the alt-right pushes this narrative. A number of prominent medical officials have noted China 'bought the world time' with its extreme containment measures. Well, except America. The US sat on its ass not testing people and not providing guidance to hospitals on the infrastructure improvements they need. Major hospitals in China have hundreds of ventilators because of past epidemics. American hospitals, well, you're lucky if your local hospital has 5.
Irrelevant Authority	Dave Meltzer has been reviewing professional wrestling matches longer than many of the people here have been ALIVE.  Its not that people take his review and star ratings as concrete but rather they respect his opinion and his vast experience reviewing and watching pro wrestling matches and believe his rankings   (The man has probably watched more wrestling matches than just about anyone right now)  And if that doesnt do it for you, then dont pay attention to them, but there are plenty of good reasons to take stock in the Meltzer star reviews. The man has been doing it as long as anyone.  If you cant put stock in Meltzer's reviews; then fuck.. Who's reviews can you put stock into?
Irrelevant Authority	I especially love it when this subreddit tries to talk down to Cruz, as if they somehow know more about MMA than he does.

I believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies.... The issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people, to whom it properly belongs.""

Irrelevant Authority	The Nobel prize-winning scientist who discovered HIV looked at covid and asserts it is a bioengineered virus, so what's the problem with a dedicated cypherpunk expressing the same?  Besides, if you truly follow crypto, you would already be worried about China. You would be naturally be opposed to anything that is the opposite of crypto, which would include CCP and its abusive, centralized, untransparent nature...
Irrelevant Authority	This is one doctor vs. almost everyone else in their field though. I want to get out of my house just as much as the next person but we can't cherry pick information and articles and run around telling everyone how wrong they are. (Although that's most of reddit).

Irrelevant Authority	But McVay has been in the NFL for years and years. Who are we to criticize? None of us have coached or played at an elite level before. Us criticizing a football coach for his decisions is like the casual reader challenging a scientist for his discoveries. Who are we to judge on a subject that we are not qualified for? Shouldn't we trust his judgement of a coach who is much more knowledgable and experienced in his field?
Irrelevant Authority	If you would actually like to hear an answer to this, feel free to message me. I hold advanced degrees in biological engineering and the more I learn about the body and the world, the more I wonder how people can manage not to believe in a God. Having explanations for some science stuff is a far cry from disproving God. The opposite, IMHO.

Irrelevant Authority	LOL the editors all agreed it was good enough for publication in The Lancet. I'm going to side with their expertise rather than a angry redditor screed nearly 100% of the time when it comes to medical knowledge.

Irrelevant Authority	Any science heads want to validate this study?
Irrelevant Authority	I'm not trying to defend Respawn here, but why is it that everyone on reddit always has the answer? They have a ton of data telling them way more than whatever people are yelling about here.  Sure there might a vocal majority(or minority in reality) on reddit wanting solos, but what if their data doesnt support it? What if a tiny percent of the playerbase actually played solo when it was available. What if those who are most vocal are just a very small minorty of players.  More than likely they have so much information from every one of us playing the game that they probably have a good idea about what they are doing.  Not to mention what they have already said, the game was developed and built around squads and teamplay. All the legend abilites, knockdown shields, ress beacons etc focus on teamplay. They obviously have a philosophy behind what they want and what they are doing.

Irrelevant Authority	This is where a person who is biased is trying to twist the data into their own narrative, which is never good on either side. You are telling me that one of the most decorated and elite fighter squadrons with top of the line sensors in the NAVY couldn't tell the difference between a plane and an unknown? That is super insulting to the pilots, who are arguable the best in the world, and to say this sitting looking at solely a computer screen is beyond hubris. Try this, that is an unknown and that is it, don't say it is alien or a plane, and leave it as unknown - not everything has an answer with our understanding of science.
Irrelevant Authority	Well, if the co-discoverer of DNA Francis Crick believes our genetic code shows evidence of directed panspermia, I think I'll give his view more weight than pretty much anyone on Reddit.
Irrelevant Authority	I also saw the excerpt that youre citing as the main thesis.  Although the author didnt really dive into how an idea is decided to be meritorious or not, Id imagine his ideal model would be similar to the process of peer review for publication in an academic journal.  A council of respected experts in a field can certainly weed out the poorly crafted ideas.  If someone cant get their work published in a journal (or has but such work has later been debunked), then why should they be given a speaking platform at a college or university?
Irrelevant Authority	"As a child and adolescent psychiatrist, I'm like, ""come at me, bro. I haz research."". They're still assholes but they can't claim to be more of an expert in the field than I am!"
Irrelevant Authority	You know how non-theists get super frustrated with the woeful ignorance of Christians when they ignore simple science because it doesnt match their faith?  Well that fits in the same category as the Jesus Mythicist arguments.   Justify it all you want. Try to bring your scientific methods into it fine. But you are simply ignorant of actual, academic historical methods used to determine the historicity of basic figures and events throughout time. The vast majority of secular historians agree on this. Only the most devout and biased anti-theists make this claim. It was popular in the Soviet era and runs through similar circles now.   Lay aside any faith based interpretations on the life of Jesus. They arent needed to make the very simple historical conclusion that a man existed.  Go ahead and vote me down now.

Irrelevant Authority	It's very odd how average people sitting behind a computer screen in their dorm or rented room, are infantilizing/criticizing two men who have achieved more out of life than most people could possibly hope or imagine.   They're holding the top office in two of the most prominent countries in the world and have gotten their on their hard work (even rallying takes a lot of work and work ethic and unspeakable effort, early mornings, sleepless nights, constant travel), they have connected with hundreds of thousands of people, and will leave a legacy. They have families and have provided for themselves and their loved ones to last generations. They have donated more than an average person makes in years, and changed people's lives for the better through a multitude of ways.  Love them or hate them, the criticism is always odd. It makes me want to ask 'What have you done today?' At least you can do your laundry list, I guess.

Irrelevant Authority	Read the post. I did show it to be true. Not in excruciating detail, but just by appealing to all of the towering intellects throughout history and up until the present that have accepted some religion as true.   And I am sure some atheists have engaged with the arguments Im talking about, but many of them have not. Just look at Stephen Fry and his Big Think interview. He thinks saying why is there so much evil in the world is a knockdown objection to the existence of God, when its only the beginning of a discussion that has been going on for thousands of years and can be traced back to Deuteronomy.
Irrelevant Authority	"Speaking of the ""right"" to health care, in 1961 Ronald Reagan, I'm paraphrasing here, basically sayed this (this is not the exact quote):  ""Socialized medicine leads to socialism""  So, yeah, let's not have that, also in a Canadian Supreme Court case, Chaoulli v Quebec, the court ruled that, the Quebec Health Insurance Act and also the Hosptial Insurance Act, that prohibit private medical insurance due to the long waiting times, is violated the Quebec Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms and Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.  Sadly the decision only applied to Quebec, but even still, this means it's immoral."

Irrelevant Authority	It baffles me that the NRA just let people getting killed while doctors have no say about preventing more tragedies 
Irrelevant Authority	Haidt is a highly respected psychologist and has written some great books.  Anything he has to say is worth listening to.  Your comment is unfounded.

Irrelevant Authority	People in this thread actually think they're smarter than Harvard law students 
Irrelevant Authority	I think I know the correct answer to this but I need proof.   I was watching a game yesterday and a player was flying Obi-Wan in the aethersprite. He performs a red maneuver and says that since the maneuver was fully executed he can use FTC before the check stress step. I tried explaining that a maneuver isn't considered fully executed until after the check stress step. Just trying to get clarification on which is right. He said he has talked to tourney judges and they said that FTC can be used before the check stress step. That doesn't seem right to me. 
Irrelevant Authority	"""uneducated, personal opinion"" lmao Adam and his team do lots of research for every episode of Adam Ruins Everything, and in addition to that Adam Conover has a college degree in Philosophy. Maybe if you wanted the absolute best degree for policy-making, something like History or Economics could be better, but Philosophy is a solid field and much more accurate for critiquing society than any STEM degree which I assume these commenters have, for the few that even have a college degree. I mean don't get me wrong, STEM degrees are great, but not very relevant in this case. Adam probably prefaces a lot of stuff with ""I""m not an expert"" but he's definitely a lot closer to one than most Joe Rogan listeners (or guests, for that matter). There's probably something to be said about the Dunning-Kruger effect here."

Irrelevant Authority	Im sure young people couldnt tell you how vaccines work either but would be up in arms if someone tried to ban them. Usually its a better idea to listen to the experts rather than try to become one yourself, because youre more likely to make mistakes.
Irrelevant Authority	Did anything in my post say I agreed with the thread? No, it didnt, so I have nothing to reconsider.  Did people say they were offended or something was offensive? Yes, they did. To that, see Stephen Fry quote. Do you disagree with Stephen Fry?
Irrelevant Authority	Jewish people are calling them concentration camps.

Irrelevant Authority	"He is one of, if not the most, famous ""victims"" of these abuses AND in the know about all of the intricate details.  If he still thinks it needs to stay, after everything he's been through with Russia-gate maybe we should listen...   Many protections exist, most importantly the FISA court, to ensure that US Citizens are not illegitimately ""unmasked"" in this process.  Those protections,  we now know, were purposely ignored and information was withheld on purpose which led to Trump having his ""wires tapped."" As he has consistently said he wants to and is working towards ensuring this never happens to another President."

Irrelevant Authority	I will go out on a limb, and say the Japanese chef for cooks these professionally might know more about how to do it correctly ... than you do.
Irrelevant Authority	Yeah, yeah, yeah, whatever... All your post is countered easily by one thing - Golden Lion in Venice. These are not the kind of people who watch only mainstream movies, and they selected it over any other movie at the festival. So, your argument is invalid from the start.
Irrelevant Authority	"You can't really claim ""lately"", and then link an article from 2016.  Edit: If you need further proof, you should check out kubernetes (or openshift). That's how Google does stuff, they use containers. Netflix also does.  Guess you probably heard of those."
Irrelevant Authority	"At least the author is up front about being ill informed on the subject and not knowing of any negative utilitarians. Not that it justifies the logical fallacies all over this essay. I mean he even starts off using an appeal to popularity/authority as a reason not to bother doing the necessary research to find one.   ""Negative Utilitarianism (NU) is treated as a non-starter in mainstream philosophical circles, and to the best of my knowledge has never been supported by any mainstream philosopher, living or dead."""
Irrelevant Authority	yeah, don't listen to me.

Irrelevant Authority	I *kind of* agree, because we essentially let parents do it, and teachers are in a similar position of authority (both parents' and teachers' roles are to install discipline), but the problem is that it kind of opens up a can of worms - if we're saying that they can be hit because they are at the age of accountability (as opposed to being too young) then surely this would mean any adult can be hit for criminal behaviour? is that a road we want to go down? but I know what you mean - maybe it's not at the age of accountability, and maybe it's at the age where the only thing they'll understand is pain and not guilt 
Irrelevant Authority	"Honestly though, a PhD is not necessary to have an informed opinion. If that were the case, a lot of pro vaxxers wouldn't have an informed opinion either and let's be honest: they don't. Herd mentality is as much a thing as herd immunity.   What antivaxxers need is someone with a PhD drawing a conclusion they agree with so they can repeat and circlejerk that to oblivion. And someone with a PhD should know the difference between an actual result and ""oh hey one number out of 100 says this so it must be true"".   And even then they will be a minority, but at least it can sufficiently instigate some doubt."
Irrelevant Authority	I think Season 8 was far better than people give it credit. But it was still a train wreck in the final assessment, in my opinion.   Thanks for demonstrating the same dismissive behaviors the essay and Dr Haidt are describing.
Irrelevant Authority	But at least some Christians don't make their own decisions in this case.    They cite the work of previous religious people to justify the canon you have. If you were building your canon from scratch based on your own logic at least liberal Christians would have serious issues justifying keeping books widely believed to be forgeries today.  Dale Allison certainly believes that there are forgeries and interpolations. Yet he cannot just remove them. So he IS looking to older Christians and the traditions they made.
Irrelevant Authority	When people who play in the professional scene and other people in the top 10-1% agree  a hero is bad, its probably because that hero is bad. Or do the players in the top 10%+ not play hard enough?
Irrelevant Authority	"So, you dismiss the analysis of any number of pro players and community analysts as ""biased judgement resulting from a resistance to change"" rather than acknowledging the validity of their own positions, *and then* ask to be heard out yourself.   Not exactly the best rhetorical strategy for getting a point across."

Irrelevant Authority	the only gaslighting is coming from people who don't understand it's medical care, approved by doctors, and paid for by private insurance, so state insurance should cover it as well  if doctors and all the major medical organizations say it's clinical medicine that treats a medical problem, and you are here saying you know better then they do on a medical issue, you're the wrong one
Irrelevant Authority	Right, because you know more than Elizabeth Warren.

Irrelevant Authority	"It's not 'made up'. this is a historian who bases his thesis on research.   from the radio broadcast: the historian bases his thesis on stories of Jesus from Eastern regions (Syria, Palestine etc), which are outside the Roman empire. These maintain that he was \_not\_ a son of God, but was a man of God. The Christian new testament, then, is the 'Western' story.   Have not read the book, so I cannot offer an opinion on his sources. But Fried is a bona fide academic historian. And having been a fellow at the Institute for Advanced Study, he is certainly a well-regarded member of the academy.    From Wikipeida: ""Fried studied at the University of Heidelberg, where he obtained his doctorate in 1970 and his habilitation in 1977. He was professor at the University of Cologne 1980-1983 and holds the Chair of Mediaeval History at the University of Frankfurt am Main since 1983. He has been visiting Fellow at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton 1995-1996."""

Irrelevant Authority	Tell that to Oxford economist Martin Wolf. If only he had seen your insightful analysis before he published his own research...
Irrelevant Authority	I'll give some initial thoughts:  >Economic growth occurs when an economy produces more valuable goods.  Not when people lack the money to buy such goods.  1. It decreases the incentive for workers to quickly find new employment  once theyre out of a job, and 2) it decreases their sensitivity to  income differences between jobs.  Though he doesn't cite where he's getting this info (it seems he might be assuming this), I'd like to counter this by adding that people on disability would then have the buying power to re-enter the labor force.  It's also interesting to note that this was written by an economics student. Yang has an econ degree from brown and the idea he's proposing was supported by over 1000 other economists in 1970-72. 1000 economists vs an economics student. I'm inclined to listen to the consensus of many experts over the ideas of one student.

Irrelevant Authority	Well, some brief research tells me that he's not taken very seriously in the scientific community. So if you don't mind me asking, why do you take his work seriously?   For me, I distrust him because of my lack of expertise. I believe that because I am not an expert, it's only fair that I yield my opinions to whatever the consensus amongst experts might be. This will, of course, result in me being wrong at times, but I believe it to be the scientific way of thinking and if I'm paying thousands of dollars to be a scientist I might as well think like one lol.

I'm a guy and think that the way that gender roles affect men is important, but MRA people really only want to take down feminism, as if it has been so institutionalized that women no longer experience oppression and it's just a tool to keep men down. If they really cared about their own rhetoric of ""fighting for equality"", then they would reach out to feminism. But no, *their* struggle has to be more important and if a feminist doesn't reach out, it's their fault and not the MRA's.  EDIT: Went to /r/feminisms, saw that Audre Lorde quote, subscribed."

Hasty Generalization	The research shows that liberals dont just trust a politician just for saying that theyre liberal. Thats a good thing, critical thinking and all.

Jesus foretold his Resurrection to his Apostles several times before his Sacrificial Death, so that Sins might be Forgiven. And if We are United to Jesus, We too have hope for our own Resurrection from the Dead...That is why I am a Christian, Along with other Reasons!God is the Greatest! Jesus Reveals Him. Unworthy Servant of Jesus Christ, John...Member of the RCC Church.
Hasty Generalization	That wasn't eloquent at all. It was basically Brand expressing himself by poetically rambling on for 14 minutes about fucking nonsense.  Brand makes extensive use of these 2 logical fallacies: [Proof by Verbosity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_by_verbosity) & [Appeal to Emotion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeal_to_emotion)   If you are at all impressed by Brand as a man of eloquence and reason your a gullible smuck who can easily be fooled by smooth talk. Please do yourself a favor and look up [underhanded and falsifiable discussion techniques](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacy) before you end up being taken advantage of.
Hasty Generalization	Typical liberal tactic. When you can't fight on merit or facts, you resort to name calling. 
Hasty Generalization	People with critical thinking capability tend to able to resolve better solutions in all areas including politics.  Further, people marry because they find someone who is kind. I expect it's not really a matter of politics being important, so much as that conservatives are not naturally kind; liberal minds will tend to resist the limits that conservatives project.  The world would be a better place if we taught critical thinking and avoidance of fallacies.
Hasty Generalization	I always thought socialism was for punk little bitches who got a degree in fine arts who had to move back home?
Hasty Generalization	A lot of my family on my dad's side use the N word and don't want anyone dating colored people. They're republicans.
Hasty Generalization	Apparently now making a Holocaust joke means being a Trump supporter.  You're either stupid, OR you're implying that Trump supporters are Nazis.
Hasty Generalization	Just another quality One Nation member.
Hasty Generalization	Strawman argument.  No one believes in segregation or is advocating for its return
Hasty Generalization	and this is why UCF or any other non p5 should NEVER be allowed near the playoff
Hasty Generalization	Its the republican way. A political party so driven by greed and fear they actually praise ignorance. Theyre an embarrassment to mankind.
Hasty Generalization	Well, perhaps threatening to rape and murder women isn't the best way to go about getting more small print under your article headlines?
Hasty Generalization	This just in: when columnists write about something, they select the information that supports their thesis.

Hasty Generalization	I thought Nazis loved getting pissed on, what gives?
Hasty Generalization	I agree with IncelTears pretty often, but after seeing one of the catfished girls fully accepting a chad profile who pretended to molest a boy in the past, I think Incels do have a point.
Hasty Generalization	"Where are the idiots who claim ""bOtH sIdEs"" isn't true."
Hasty Generalization	One of the cornerstones of the Intelligent Design creationism movement is that people who endorse the theory of evolution are either Nazis and racists or [on their way to being Nazis and racists.](http://www.evolutionnews.org/2011/10/can_darwinists_condemn_hitler052331.html) In light of that, I'd say this letter was a politely worded refusal by comparison.  There's no reasonable discourse with DI. They bury logic under bullshit professionally. Debating them can only lend legitimacy to their asinine cause. *If* they were to get their crap together and actually publish some science, *if* they were to gain traction in scientific circles on merit rather than gaining traction among the general public with propaganda, and *if* they started demonstrating any understanding of or respect for scientific method, *then* it might be reasonable to debate them as peers in science. 
Hasty Generalization	What is so wrong with measles. I had them, my brother had them and 1/2 my grade school had them 50 years ago and after a week we were all OK. I do not know anything about the autism issue or care to discuss. I just want to know why we must act like lemmings when the government says we need to be vaccinated against a disease which has a smaller death rate than being struck by lightening. When do we get a vaccine for lightening strikes, please line up lemmings. Why is it the government wants the pharmaceutical companies so profitable.  http://www.safeminds.org/blog/2015/01/29/since-become-afraid-measles/
Hasty Generalization	Some of the most successful people I know grew up with their back against the wall with way worse conditions than this gal.  Sorry but some of the most unsuccessful people I know grew up with a silver spoon.  
Hasty Generalization	I have a few friends who went to Buso,  they are pretty much normal functioning adults with a few quirks.    I think that if they went to the normal system they wouldn't have turned out this well. 
Hasty Generalization	Gen Z here.. I'm a progressive 
Hasty Generalization	Funny that none of my friends who farm or hunt or target shoot or carry a sidearm for work in Alberta talk like this guy. It's almost as if the folks they find for these news articles aren't a true representation of Albertans. 
Hasty Generalization	But that still seems underestimated. That's because I personally know at least 100 people who are in Australia and that's from my close social network. Then there are people I hear often who are immigrating to Australia. Extrapolating from there 100K seems to be much lower, doesn't it? 
Hasty Generalization	"Journalists, in general, ARE bad people.  I think of all the people I knew who did journalism in college.  Total ass hats.  And now because they are working i journalism I am supposed to think they are somehow above the fold?  I'm sorry, but ""journalists"" in the modern age are nothing more than click-bait hungry dimwits.  Broadcast and print."
Hasty Generalization	I dont know a single person who buys $5 coffee everyday. 
Hasty Generalization	Look, Im gonna say this to anyone who says that meat and dairy is bad for you. Show me at least 3 peer reviewed and published scientific papers that clearly state that meat and dairy is bad for you.  Look if that were the case, my grandmother wouldnt have lived to 93, she drank milk and ate meat all her life and was still kicking it until her last few years.

Hasty Generalization	Ever since i've changed my preferred rules i've only gotten 1v1 no items. I've played over 100 online battles already. I've also only had 2 unbearable laggy matches. Less than 5 matches have not been omega/bf but they had hazards off.  I'm in Elite now and the games are fine.
Hasty Generalization	> Then theres the issue where 99% of programmers wouldnt want to live in the middle of nowhere.   Based on the number of peers I know in the 'middle of nowhere', I think you're wrong.
Hasty Generalization	Ive heard so many atheists say those things. I would not throw in something that I randomly heard a couple times. Thats dishonest , That goes for atheists I have met in person, watched online, or read comments from. Its not hasty in the slightest bit 
Hasty Generalization	To be fair, I personally know 3 people for whom bs advice like this has worked. Or at least they say it did. I never antagonize it for that reason.
Hasty Generalization	I've only been vote-kicked once in ~200 hours. If you are being kicked so frequently either you are joining the wrong servers or doing something wrong.
Hasty Generalization	I think the whole discussion is an intentional distraction from gun control which we desperately need.  I have played violent video games all my life and I'm no murderer.
Hasty Generalization	"Or, more accurately, many liberal professors abuse their positions by attempting to force their political opinions into subjects they don't belong in, like the English professor who insists their students each write a paper on ""Why the GOP are terrorists"" and grade students poorly who disagree with that opinion (experienced that first hand). Many of the big name institutions have become incestuous single minded orgies which no longer challenge students to think out of the box, challenge assumed truths and seek to learn all they can, but instead have become factories to produce a very specific set of opinions and mindsets never to be questioned.   This isn't a call to abolish higher learning, but I think the entire system needs to be reassessed, not only due to outrageous costs and access issues."
Hasty Generalization	Growing up on a cow farm and knowing the industry, I know no one who treats their cows like this. The farming regulations would make a lot of that difficult to sell because of the conditions.  While Im not saying theyre not mistreating the animals, Im just saying that isnt as commonplace as theyre making it appear. Also cows arent that helpless, if we even remotely tried to pull any of those stunts with our calves we probably wouldnt have made it out of the shed.

Hasty Generalization	Perhaps Islamic people shouldn't behead other humans on camera and then post it for the ENTIRE WORLD to see, perhaps Islamic people shouldn't put Fatwah's out on people who draw their god, and then perhaps there wouldn't be a need for Draw Muhammed contests.
Hasty Generalization	There are no riots happening.... okay maybe there's a small riot.  There are no fires being lit.... okay maybe there's some small fires.  There are no detainees being kept in cages....
Hasty Generalization	It's weird how every team does that and yet there are so many mediocre pitchers with poor records still there. I swear that every fanbase thinks their team specializes in making AAA spot starters look like Cy Young and is positive that their manager is the absolute worst at bullpen management. I'm not ragging on you, just wondering how many people would agree with these statements if you asked them no matter what team they root for. 
Hasty Generalization	What an absolute bullshit article, i'm not even a Tumper but i fucking get his point about the media supporting their left wing bullshit.
Hasty Generalization	"Someone once told me they have an ""alt"" cause their main account was too high of rank to play with their friends. It's exactly the same as smurfing."
Hasty Generalization	I've seen plenty comments on here assuming it's only Reddit that has issues with the game
Hasty Generalization	When lag goes away he wins, and wins single handily? Meaning he believes his current rank is because of latency and NOT skill.  I can believe that, I recently bought a Thunderbolt->Ethernet adapter for my phone and it reduced my latency to the servers significantly (also a lot less PL) and I jumped up 500rp in two days. Now I'm hovering around 2900/3200.  This game is very dependent on latency to the server, I'd say more so than raw skill. 
Hasty Generalization	Yeah, but I really haven't seen a lot of men mentioning it to me in private or otherwise either. And it sure as hell isn't because I talk with guys in socially acceptable circles.  Any imageboard, forum, whatever where everyone just says anything on their mind, I never see any great amount of men expressing their secret interest in serial killers or the sort of morbid things women do. All I see is racism, misanthropy or muh-soggy-knee, and the only ones talking about serial killers are those who adore them, usually either Breivik or Elliot ( Whereas women with a serial killer interest tend to be fascinated more with the 'classic' kinds, American Psycho style )  So social acceptance can't be it.
Hasty Generalization	My sister is a Chinese national, she says theres no such thing as a social credit score. She said they set up a system where if someone takes out a loan and cant pay it back, and has been proven in court to have been spending the money in appropriately, gambling and such, then they get put on a list that puts their picture and name in shameful spots.
Hasty Generalization	Well I've done time at Lee arrendale and assure you..women in there have burned their significant other alive,killed their parents,killed their children.the list goes on.ive seen evil women in prison doing life for horrible crimes
Hasty Generalization	My uncle was riding his motorcycle when he got hit hard by a 15 year old out joy riding while his parents were on vacation. At the time my uncle was 19. Almost died but survived. Is blind now. Tons of plastic surgery. Depression. Mental health issues. Crappy jobs. Has to have family support him. Think again.

Hasty Generalization	100% of the time any of you say the word 'statist' you're pulling at least 2 of these.
Hasty Generalization	The average consumer doesn't care about specs. They don't care if the body changes. They only care about if this device solves their problems and if said problem solving is done better with device a over b. specs only matter if they affect the problem solving. The 4s has a better camera, don't need to bring a camera with me. Life easier. Siri makes keeping your to do lists and alarms much easier and it answers random facts from wolfram and does google searches faster than typing them in (when it's working) again another problem solved. Unsurprisingly apple can't sell these things faster.   People on reddit aren't regular users. The iPhone 4s is the number one selling phone, people don't care about a redesign as long as the machine is still better in a quantifiable way. Apple is selling to them. 
Hasty Generalization	My experience with fat people who blame their obesity on genetics is that they usually are unaware of how much they over eat and how much complete garbage makes up their diet.

Hasty Generalization	"Lol when a Muslim denounces Christmas he is butt hurt but when an [atheist](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6Hw9oQMFrs) does it he is a hero. Typical atheist irrationality.  ""Atheism is so senseless and odious to mankind"" - Isaac Newton"
Hasty Generalization	"A huge portion of the black population thinks just like him. They make decisions based off of the ""logic"" that he's displaying here."
Hasty Generalization	White people. Really. I cannot stand white people. Grew up in Kansas and white people are condescending, elitist, and self absorbed. ALL of them.
Hasty Generalization	"So?  You apply for the job anyway and see what happens.  My first job in Toronto was in tech support at an ISP.  I had previously seen a posting for a webmaster position at that company but they listed all sorts of ""requirements"" that I didn't have, so I didn't bother applying despite being qualified in that area.  Six months later, guess which job I'm doing? (Hint: it wasn't tech support.)  I don't even hold a degree.  The piss-poor, defeatist attitude that many of you millennials display is holding you back from your full potential.  I thought my fellow Gen-Xers were cynical, but you guys are just too much.  "
Hasty Generalization	"I've never seen it work our successfully IRL and am super super skeptical of most people's ability to do so. I'm not interested in that dynamic, and think that, ime, there are lots of textbook issues associated with them. I think that, legally, that dynamic could cause a lot of issues, and I'm not sure how that would work. I wish I could see it more as ""you do you,"" but I can't un-see the trends I've seen in open or poly relationships IRL, and that affects my view"
Hasty Generalization	I would love to say I agree with this, but my experience with people reading up on their logical fallacies is that they just become keyboard worries who still don't know how to use logic. People just accusing each other of various fallacies, and we are back to square one.  Gottlob Fregge! Where are you when I need you?
Hasty Generalization	My aunt had a Pitbull that did not attack a single person  That is because the pitbulls trained not to attack anyone

Hasty Generalization	I've defended child rapists, domestic abusers, arsonists, robbers, burglars, thieves, drunk drivers, and many and myriad misdemeanants. That's what a defense lawyer does. And yet, out of all of my friends who know exactly what I do, not one of them has ever been uncomfortable with me watching their kids for them, driving their car, staying in their houses, or anything else, or shown any worry over the well being of my wife.   Methinks their feelings of unsafety might be a tad histrionic.
Hasty Generalization	I am pro-life and I have adopted two children. 
Hasty Generalization	2 chicks rejected me for being a virgin. I had sex as soon as I started lying about having had sex. And all those weren't even casual sex, it was in the frame of relationships.

Hasty Generalization	"I've never understood the whole ""it'll make them gay"" argument. I wore tights when I was a kid, wore nail polish until I was 18, wore eyeliner, went in drag to almost every Halloween event and still ended up straight.         It's almost as if it's not a choice at all and your upbringing has zero effect on your sexuality. Crazy."
Hasty Generalization	It wouldn't be unfair. I play with 4 friends and 3 of us are on PC, but 3 of them also play on controller. The best of all of us plays on controller. When you add aim assist in, the gap is not large at all.
Hasty Generalization	How about that time they genocided Cyprus? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kitos_War#Cyprus
Hasty Generalization	I agree with you when it comes to child abuse it is a horrible thing and it plagues the children.   However, I think it is important for us to draw a line somewhere. For someone who grew up in the 90's getting spanked for some shinanigans was common and quite frankly I'm in line because of it.   I think there's a problem when people stop hitting kids because it is the law but use psychological/mental means to punish them. It can leave scars just as deep as cuts.   A slap on the wrist or spanks isn't a big deal and kids do need to learn that bigger mistakes have bigger consequences.

Hasty Generalization	I've been in okc.  The pictures that men put up are often terribly unflattering.  I've seen guys I know from the real world on there--reasonably attractive guys--who look awful.  Women in dating sites tend to realize the importance of their profile picture and how much guys will care about it.  As far as I can tell, many guys do not.

Hasty Generalization	That's not on even for a heroin addict leaving shit around schools. The few addicts I know (none for heroin though) are respectful and only use when they have the free time, and always in their house not bothering anyone else. 
Hasty Generalization	Bullshit.  The worst police I've experienced were bored jackoffs, drunk on their own egos like little gods in small, low crime rural towns.   &nbsp;   Change the training, get some serious overwatch in place like required body cams,  and most important, remove the IQ cap so we can once more have intelligent police officers.    &nbsp;   Occasionally remind them that other citizens actually have rights, that'd be good as well.

Hasty Generalization	"When healthy poor people, or less fortunate people, or people in the dumps (whatever term you want to use) constantly complain about how hard work will get them nowhere, or that the ""system just ain't fair"" or that the gubmint system ""owes them""...they need to just stfu and admit they ARE lazy and have NO aspirations.  Because hard work, intellectually and/or physically, can drag anyone out of poverty if they make the choice.  I don't share his race, but I grew up fatherless, 3 kids growing up in a shit trailer park, no money to speak of, a mother who was too busy working to raise us.  Finished high school, military @ 17 yo, then college, two degrees in engineering fields, now happily married and VERY comfortable.  But I worked my FUCKING ass off instead of sitting around waiting for someone to fix my situation.  So good for him...he's doing it right."

Black-and-White Fallacy	For the people who are against the tax cuts, would you have preferred a tax raise instead? 
Black-and-White Fallacy	Ultimately, we're arguing either for a dictatorship of the proletariat or a dictatorship of capital. Just so everyone's clear on that.

Black-and-White Fallacy	Yeah what a jerk! Doesnt he know brinksmanship between nuclear powers is the future we all want??
Black-and-White Fallacy	Probably the same people who bitch about being the lost generation or whatever.  If only they could get back to the heady days of being drafted, shoveling asbestos, working in coal mines, or laying railroads.  MMMMMMM mm.  I am just jealous just thinking about their purchasing power back then.  Mmm boy.  One day laying railroads and would you believe the purchasing power.  OOoowee.  I'd trade palces with them in a second.  Give up my vaccines, give up my antibiotics, my silly little telly phone, my high safety vee hickle.  Oh yes.  Just head right on back, thats for me.
Black-and-White Fallacy	Submission statement:  This is the architect that was responsible for renovations of Notre Dame and he retired sometime in the 2010's.  The translation is incorrect when it says he retired earlier.  He hypothesizes only a fire accelerate could have achieved the burning that occurred.  That means two options, either a very sophisticated terrorist attack or some sort of false flag conspiracy.
Black-and-White Fallacy	Build me a pyramid using only the techniques that the mainstream archeologists state the Egyptians used and then I'll believe it wasn't aliens that helped them
Black-and-White Fallacy	He is either retarded, or successfully became US President. Pick one
Black-and-White Fallacy	"&gt;Bernie has always been an activist  Exactly. There's a difference between being an activist and being a president. For example, Presidents (usually) have to be pragmatic. Activists do not. A president says ""Medicare for All is the best option but ObamaCare is a good start"". An activists says ""Medicare for All or we burn this shit down"". And there's nothing wrong with either person taking their positions. I want my activists pushing for the best to drive the agenda forward; and I want my presidents (politicians) not afraid to take a good deal instead of waiting around for the best deal."
Black-and-White Fallacy	I think this is where there is some disconnect between both sides. How things are right now I am inclined to agree with that more than disagree.   The problem is it pushes the notion of well if you don't have ICE then you must want open borders. I would hope you would agree that open borders would not be good and there needs to be some kind of enforcement. Just that ice is doing a piss poor job at it with piss poor leadership and policies in place.  So all for removing ICE and replacing it with something else.
Black-and-White Fallacy	The possibilities are;  Godidit! or Nuthididit!  The obvious condition of human angst does not have a credible naturalistic explanation.  It fits better in the creation model, and is evidence FOR the Creator.
Black-and-White Fallacy	In the time of universal deceit, telling the truth is a revolutionary act.  Does that make these two scientists heroes? Undoubtedly.  This coronavirus debacle will either be the end of a free humanity, or a new beginning.  I choose the latter.
Black-and-White Fallacy	Not to hate on the Thunderbirds, but an F-16C costs $7,000-$24,000 per flight hour.  Just guessing but they were up there for 4 hours or so, so $140,000 to $480,000.   I'd have rather watched a video of the Thunderbirds and used the money they spent on gas and maintenance to buy PPE for area hospitals (or Citizens, if Hospitals have enough). Or pay the $70 Million bill for hospital buildouts.  Pretty great picture though.
Black-and-White Fallacy	TLDR;  Im bad, game sucked. 
Black-and-White Fallacy	Can't they if they have enough power(capital= power)? I believe it was apple that had their own police unit to investigate a new device leak. Corporations wouldn't have any regulations to follow so it would become a free for all.
Black-and-White Fallacy	I think that the writer is dishonestly cherry picking data that supports his cause. The idea that we have a gun problem rather than a mental health problem is frankly absurd. The assertion that mentally ill people only commit 5% of the violent crime is absurd. If you, unprovoked, desire to harm another human you are mentally ill to some extent. It doesn't matter if you were diagnosed yet or not.  Furthermore this is the first study I've ever read that shows legal CCW increases violent crime and the statistical models he cites were used to manipulate the data could be complete garbage we have no way of knowing because the data being sampled and how it's being manipulated is conveniently omitted. 
Black-and-White Fallacy	&gt;by downvoting the game, you only hurt GBX, 2K and all the fans of BL.   &gt;2K   Well that's the point. 2K is the publisher and they decided they would rather have it be an Exclusive on Epic Games Store because $$$. When you give a game a negative review, someone who may be looking to buy a game will often look at reviews and if they see that the game has poor reviews then they won't buy the game. This would hurt 2K but sadly it would also affect Gearbox. 2K takes most of the profits from BL as they are the publisher though. This would be a way to have 2K as well as other publishers know that taking Epic's $$$ for exclusivity is a really bad thing if they care about their fans and customers.
Black-and-White Fallacy	Remember: kids cant be trusted to make decisions about their health and use of products until 21, but can make decisions about elected officials, signing up in the army and buying a house at 18
Black-and-White Fallacy	So you think intelligence differences among differing populations are 100% environmental and genetics have nothing to do with it?
Black-and-White Fallacy	Read The Gulag Archipelago. Full audiobook on YouTube. The opposite of capitalism is communism. Endless suffering. Capitalism is decentralized voting via markets. Communism is government (the rich and powerful) enslaving the citizenry.

Black-and-White Fallacy	In war its hard to tell who exactly are the good guys and bad guys.   &amp;#x200B;  But on a whim, I just decided to side with the guys that didn't turn our grandmothers into sex slaves for the entire imperial army.  Where the Americans self-serving in their colonial aspirations, sure. But last time I checked, they weren't bayoneting fetuses out of pregnant filipinas.  &amp;#x200B;  If you think for one second that our life under imperial Japan would be one amazing anime love story, guess again.

Black-and-White Fallacy	There are two possibilities: Either he is stupid or, being part of the richer class, he sees his own interests at stake when someone like Bernie is in power.

Black-and-White Fallacy	Biden vs Trump is like a like choosing between having a dog leave a lump of dry shit or diarrhea on your driveway.  You would prefer neither, but at least the lump is easier to deal with.  Trump's the diarrhea you got to hose down multiple times and use some bleach.
Black-and-White Fallacy	Lack of research is the price we pay for being able to get this things without a prescription.   It's usually a worthwhile trade, IMO

Black-and-White Fallacy	Even if both sides are evil(not true, but let's pretend), why not support the lesser of the two evils? The world will be less evil.
Black-and-White Fallacy	Where does your reason from not wanting atrocities to happen come from, if there is no God and no eternity? Now, I agree that atrocities are horrific, and that we just know that they are-you also know that, and I don't discount it.  But I know that they're so bad because humans are created in God's image-so whenever a person is murdered, or is deceived into throwing away their life for a lie, it's an insult to God. The idea that killing people by crashing a plane into a building would please God is abhorrent because of how it slanders Him.  But without God, and without consequences-with people just reduced to inconsequential nothing when they die, with nothing good or bad for them, why is an atrocity so horrifying? Yet it is, without question.  I know you've probably been asked this before, but I haven't heard your answer before.
Black-and-White Fallacy	Lets increase tax rates on everything to 100%. That way we'll be able to fund everything and we can all live in mansions.

Black-and-White Fallacy	Maybe they should stop committing most of the crime, signing up to kill people in foreign countries, and just pull up their bootstraps.   Oh right, we only give those solutions to minorities. Men are truly oppressed, everyone else are just snowflakes

Black-and-White Fallacy	I have yet to do this. Looks like I'll never get accepted
Black-and-White Fallacy	"There is no doubt whatsoever that the Maduro regime is borderline dictatorial. Y'all are delusional if you think you fool anyone with your jaded anti-imperialistic talking points.  &amp;#x200B;  You can point out the hypocrisy of the US Foreign Policy (only caring for Human Rights abuses when they come from nations which are not geopolitical/ideological allies) without defending an opressive regime that you would not tolerate for a fucking second if you lived under its rule.  &amp;#x200B;  I swear, most of leftist takes on Syria or Venezuela can be run down to ""Well the US is bad and therefore these egotistical maniac dictators are right""."
Black-and-White Fallacy	How does New York State keep itself competitive if it has the highest taxes in the nation, the most red tape, without tax discounts?   These tax discounts help keep us competitive with other states.   You either cut taxes and regulations or you offer tax incentives.  Which is it?

Or is he not omnibenevolent because he needs bad things to happen as part of his plan?   Did god create the devil? Or is he ""begotten, not made"" like god? If the devil is in rebellion against god, why does he punish people who don't worship god?  Edit: typo"
Black-and-White Fallacy	you'd think this was a good thing, but religion has just been replaced by consumerism and excess. i'd rather have churches everywhere than fast food joints and shopping centres
Black-and-White Fallacy	I got a tattoo. Boyfriend of two years called me trashy, told me he hated it, berated me. I dumped him, got another tattoo. Now I have a full sleeve, and my dating life has NOT suffered. It's your body, you choose what to do with it.
Black-and-White Fallacy	From what I read, he gave us knowledge. I didn't see any instructions in the bible for making penicillin or cpu's. If the story of creation is true, then this medium we're chatting over is the result said knowledge.

Black-and-White Fallacy	Would you rather live in a Christian theocracy or a Muslim one? 
Black-and-White Fallacy	You're right.  They should instead vote for the Democrats who openly mock them and openly oppose their values.   Or they should refrain from voting and just let themselves go unrepresented. You're literally here attempting to shame them for exercising their choice, without offering an alternative.  SoooOOoo maybe they notice more that their WORST option is the Democrats, and Jesus isn't around to run for office, so the remaining choice, while imperfect, is glaringly obvious.  Just a thought. You've made absolutely no attempt to explain why they should support anyone ASIDE from the GOP.
Black-and-White Fallacy	"ITT: many virgins and other men/boys who don't understand that relationships work two ways, and just maybe this broad is batshit fucking crazy and/or a total pain in the ass. I mean, she IS a habitual poster in /r/gonewild, which means she's either a massive attention whore with little regard for her husband, or he's a douchenozzle who doesn't give her the attention she needs.

Black-and-White Fallacy	So any creature that doesn't provide for humans is useless and should therefore be destroyed?
Black-and-White Fallacy	work experience is far more valuable than a 4 year degree. you'd have to be insane to choose a 4 year degree over a 6 month bootcamp and 3 and a half years work experience.  one you might have trouble finding a job. the other you're already close to $200k
Black-and-White Fallacy	There are 2 opposing rhetorics at play  China says India is the aggressor  India and Bhutan day China is the aggressor   Worse rhetoric do you believe? Cause unless you take sides, you can't resolve a border dispute
Black-and-White Fallacy	It sounds like you just hate existence in general.   If you value being alive the idea of bringing more life into the world is a positive one.   Your only solution here is to move to a cabin in the woods all alone, or maybe get on a mission to mars where everyone will be too irradiated to reproduce. 
Black-and-White Fallacy	What kind of monster would have an emotional reaction to American deaths rather than suck the cold hard logical cock of the NRA?

Black-and-White Fallacy	If Apple truly cares about our privacy, they would be outspoken against the PATRIOT Act and the FISC. 
Black-and-White Fallacy	This is bullshit. Child separation was policy under Obama. Trump didn't instate the policy.  Besides what are you supposed to do? Put the kids in jail with adults? Yeah, that would end well.  American late night TV is full on Pravda, and Jon Liebowitz can go back to his pile of shekels and swim in it while regular American people have to actually deal with demographic replacement and ruined schools.
Black-and-White Fallacy	I blame the publishers for this.   When did Paradox change their regional pricing plans? After Crusader Kings 2 got review bombed  When did T2 change their mind about GTA V modding? After GTA V got review bombed  When did Sega decide to add Chinese localization to FM2017? After it got review bombed  When did Bethesda change their minds about Paid Mods? After Skyrim got review bombed   The problem is, publishers don't care about player feedback as long as their profits are safe, and negative reviews puts their future sales at risk, and they are the only one to blame for Review Bombing being a popular thing. If publisher would just for a minute listen to players just because they care, things would get better, for now, review bombing is sadly the only effective way to try to get a publisher to change a shit decision.  
Black-and-White Fallacy	Im not proving anything. I have reflected over my whole life. I havent reflected typing the simple concept of how god is real on Reddit. I dont know what you are doing right now but you are doing something and what you are doing is true. If you werent presently then there would be no truth but you are and its that truth that is God my understanding or not
Black-and-White Fallacy	So, they're watching from their home, which was built on top of what used to be nature, on a plastic TV/computer, surrounded by luxuries that are provided by this sort of thing.     It's all a bit hypocritical, isn't it? This kind of destruction of habitat isn't limited to Palm oil by any means. We're destroying the planet wholesale so that we can watch the latest famous rich folks on TV from the comfort of a well appointed home... and they're suddenly outraged about a chimpanzee?
Black-and-White Fallacy	I see two equally probable outcomes:  On one hand why would China want to force our hand to impose tariffs on the remaining ~300 billion by retaliating now?  On the other, they know Trump will be running on the strength of our economy in 2020 so they have motive to destroy our economy as best they can over the next year and a half in an effort to thwart his re-election bid.  To summarize, could go up, could go down.
Black-and-White Fallacy	But all Ive been told is the only thing stopping a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun.

Black-and-White Fallacy	This only makes sense if you believe businesses deserve to make profits but humans don't deserve to make a living wage.
Black-and-White Fallacy	Adapt and overcome. Or keep dying and whining, it's really that simple.
Black-and-White Fallacy	Interesting how people in here hate cops for enforcing the laws written by the people we elect.  We should fight the people responsible for the infringement, which is every gun law, and not fight the people who should enforce the laws as written.
Black-and-White Fallacy	There can only be two explanations for why so many people in society are living paycheck to paycheck.      Either they are sorely lacking in financial education, in which case it's the fault of society's education system...      Or they have to live paycheck to paycheck because life has simply become too expensive in most developed cities and capitalist economies, in which case it's the fault of the broken system that funnels wealth to those at the top and keeps everyone else below in permanent financial insecurity and penury.      We have to decide as a society, which is the lesser of two damning critiques we can live with.
Black-and-White Fallacy	Am curious, do you believe that people should avoid learning to work together to track down events in an enjoyable way that is useful practice of a skill that is useful to our modern lifestyle or do you just think its bad that people can now experience the thrill of hunting in physical space without feeling obliged to inflict harm on a poor innocent animal the way you would like to?
Black-and-White Fallacy	Male or female?  Either way, if you don't like it, change it. Analyze the causes. Fix the causes. Profit. Sorry for sounding ignorant, but nobody has control over your life other than yourself.
Black-and-White Fallacy	So if I'm not supporting the side that has nazis but im also not actively supporting the BLM side then I'm part of the problem? That's flawed logic at best. 
Black-and-White Fallacy	Then we need to make sure every citizen gets to vote on every budget, every war, every program.   You can't have it both ways if you want an actual democracy. Individual politicians shouldn't be allowed to represent the actual wishes of millions of voices and opinions.   
Black-and-White Fallacy	I would prefer that, yes. Either everyone can, or no one can. By dictating language based on skin color the idea that we are different is reinforced. That's what racism is, at its core. A belief that we're different just because of skin color.
Black-and-White Fallacy	"""Monsanto has been...""  OK.    On the other hand the USSR engaged in genocide.    I'll take Monsanto."
Black-and-White Fallacy	It's just obvious. Among men there are leaders and there are followers. Many more followers than leaders. You can call them Alpha/Beta or really whatever you want but that's just how it is.   If you don't see this then it is because you are a follower. It's that simple.
Black-and-White Fallacy	"&gt;A three-judge panel of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed a federal trial judges April ruling, which blocked the administrations so-called Remain in Mexico policy on the grounds that it endangers asylum seekers by forcing them to return to Mexico where they may face violence or suffer from lack of humanitarian resources.      ""Mexico is so dangerous that asylum seekers can't stay there.""      ""We don't need a wall.""      Pick one."
Black-and-White Fallacy	Advancement and maybe kickbacks? Either that or he's just a psychopath who gets off on destroying people's lives. Either way this asshole should never see the light of day again.
Black-and-White Fallacy	So what do we do then? Just let them die because of past trauma? Should we do the same with humans?   Dogs with trauma deserve a chance and I commend OP for it

Black-and-White Fallacy	You're just thinking about what you want instead of what you're willing to give up.   Money, stability, fun. Pick 2.
Black-and-White Fallacy	Dispensaries are better alternative to an unknown dealer on the streets. There are a lot of conspiracy theories on why cannabis is still illegal.  Frankly the one that the Alcohol and pharmaceutical industry will take a huge hit in profits is the most plausible one. It's all about the money in the end.

Black-and-White Fallacy	I always wonder why people decide they want less government instead of better government. Instead of getting rid of everything and leaving everyone to fend for themselves and die, why not fix the government. There are ways to fix corruption. There are ways to fix bureaucracies.
Black-and-White Fallacy	would you prefer yet another video with 0 upvotes of some random persons uninteresting time trial?
Black-and-White Fallacy	Either this happened pre-1990, when the mob was still in power in Nevada, or its a BS story. No casino would risk that kind of negative press over $15k. I've seen people lose twice that in a single hand at the Bellagio.
Black-and-White Fallacy	You can't be a liberal and vote GOP, so I guess nobody belongs here.
Black-and-White Fallacy	> In a meta like this, where tanks are so strong there's really no reason not to pick a tank in atleast top or jungle.  I see a good reason. The person playing top lane doesn't find playing tanks fun. This is a game which is meant to be enjoyable, if you're not enjoying league, why play? I have never played tanks as top laner and I never will. I can't carry with them and I do not like being reliant on my team to carry.   Let me ask you this question OP, Would you rather your top laner play a tank which he has no idea on how to play and doesn't want to play for the sake of 4 other individuals he has never met before or would you rather have him on his carry champion?

Black-and-White Fallacy	"Jesus: [Dies on a cross to save humanity from its sins]   Nietzsche: ""Reject Jesus, we'll create our own values!""   Normie: [Pets kitten]   Kekistani: ""Normies are cucks. Hurr, durr, I like frogs, not kittens!""  Complaining about ""virtue signalling"" it itself a signal to another group that presumes a different ""virtue"" definition, Josh. You don't get to escape the ""identities and groups are created around shared values"" thing by complaining about it... sorry.  You only get to pick which set of values you endorse. The ones that welcome strangers... or the ones that don't. "
Black-and-White Fallacy	If you sell at high prices, that makes sense, doesn't it? If you sell at bottom, you're either panicking or trying to crash the price of the asset you're selling. So if he sold big amounts at 6k, he tried to bring the price even lower and cause a total sell off. That is my logic.
Black-and-White Fallacy	Globalism means USA monopoly. End of globalism means clash of superpowers. That means war and death. You pick. 
Black-and-White Fallacy	She makes no sense because she's wrong. Her actions are totally divorced from morality and sanity, and that's what makes her evil.  If she wasn't basing her actions on faulty logic, she wouldn't be doing any of the things she's doing.

Black-and-White Fallacy	> like you cant have both.   Qi coils take space and therefore z-space. You'd have to compromise battery size in most cases. The iPhone 8 has a smaller battery as a result and the iPhone X's glass back results it in having a very fragile design per drop tests.  The world isn't just full of free design choices where you get to pack a device full.
Black-and-White Fallacy	I had this debate in that subreddit and was met with some of the most absurd reasoning I could find. People who use logic for reasoning that there is no god cannot use logic for reasoning that animals should not be killed. Cross posting because I think this is useful information to fuel any debates in the future! **What do you guys think morality is based on? society or universal?**
Black-and-White Fallacy	I hate porgs and I hate that movie and I hate this set. Sorry for being so blunt, but it's how I feel. If they're gonna make a UCS, why not a great minifig scale Lars Homestead? An iconic part of the Star Wars story, as opposed to a CG puffin created solely to be new Star Wars' version of a Minion.

Black-and-White Fallacy	There's a significant flow of labor between industry and government agencies that regulate that industry. It makes sense. How competent can an agency be making decisions about, say, the tobacco industry, if nobody there has ever worked a day in their life in the tobacco industry? 
Black-and-White Fallacy	Is Reddit going to dogpile on the *lawmaker* who literally wants to *legislate freedom of speech* and *end open discussion of ideas* at college campuses because *college kids are too sensitive and need to be exposed to the real world*. (note: It is actually a problem when a lawmaker wants to legislate speech. That is literally the only threat to freedom of speech.) Or, will reddit instead provide crocodile tears about how only white men are the targets of racism now?   
Black-and-White Fallacy	The evidence of Kushner's involvement is overwhelming. Anything other than condemnation is a veiled defence.   People bash Booker because he's entirely beholden to corporate money and has no qualms selling is out in a heartbeat. Like all neoliberals he shouldn't be trusted.   The only person that needs to be wary of propaganda is yourself. 
Black-and-White Fallacy	"What else is he supposed to say - ""Fuck Washington I want to be anywhere but here""?"
Black-and-White Fallacy	A question someone asked me once was would you rather be put in jail because you defended your family during a house robbery with an illegal gun and your family is safe and alive or would you rather have a family member killed during a house robbery because your legal baseball bat is surprisingly no match to a gun?    I am NOT saying that illegally owning guns is ok (illegal gun ownership is the problem in my opinion) but I would take protecting my family and being put in jail over having my family killed in a robbery any day.   But joke's on the robber, my home is a gun free zone so it looks like they have to use another weapon.

Keep being a beacon of hope CA and I'm sure other states will follow.
Ad Populum	Absolutely. I don't know many people do think extraterrestrials *don't* exist in one fashion or another. It's crazy to think that we're alone in a universe so vast.

Ad Populum	I think you're in the minority there. 
Ad Populum	That would just be dodging the question though. Rafa gave a pretty honest answer, which is what he does. He covered it from every angle. He said he doesn't make those decisions and admitted the decisions are tough. When the journalist used the match result to justify his question, Rafa pointed out that no one knows the future. When the journalist brought up Barty's ranking, Rafa reminded him of his own ranking and accomplishments and his appeal to the fans.   Reality is he gave a very thorough answer and he made good points. But we are so conditioned to people dodging questions that anyone gives a real answer and we find that it isn't classy. We just want them to dodge it and move on.   Rafa is not wrong at all in anything he said. He does have more fan appeal than Barty. The journalist can go take a fan vote if he doesn't believe that. It was a stupid question and Rafa put the dude in his place with facts.
Ad Populum	I am not inclined to believe the official word on this one, at all. Nor am I going to jump onto a conspiracy bandwagon. But, the idea that he would be murdered in prison was *incredibly common* among basically all the various political stripes, so why are you so instantly dismissive of the idea?
Ad Populum	The witness of countless cultures throughout history and the world experiencing God through similar contemplative practices.
Ad Populum	&gt; Almost nobody thinks this.  Take a look at the upvotes.
Ad Populum	Do you folks wrapped up NOT see that this is a punishment looking for a crime?  Do you also not see that the whole point of this circus is to distract people and avoid dealing with the real issues?    I'm not sure if people really believe in this WWE-esque political theater or if they just like the drama of it all, like watching Bravo reality TV shows.  From what I can tell, the vast majority of people tuned out of this political noise a long time ago and most really couldn't care less about any of it.
Ad Populum	There are a lot of surveys out there which demonstrate this to be false.
Ad Populum	Lots of parents get rid of their kids things if they dont clean it up or keep it neat.  Id like to hear the other side of the story, especially regarding the school supplies, and see photos of the room before passing real judgment. I can see an exasperated parent saying such a thing because theyre tired of stuff all over the floor. If thats the case, theres nothing abusive about a threat to get a kid to clean up their mess.
Ad Populum	Just from reading around online and it seems to be industry standard for djing.

Ad Populum	Not interested in a pissing contest, youve got your opinion and Ive got mine.  But, why dont you go back and watch McGregor v Diaz 2.  Plenty of sledgehammers in the first three rounds, and no stoppage!!  Was Dilashaw afforded the same opportunity, definitely not.  The reason people are talking about the stoppage is because heaps of people were asking, wtf was that??
Ad Populum	So you're the guy who says everyone else is wrong when everyone else is saying the same thing but you disagree.
Ad Populum	Any other philosophers able to back a house like this?
Ad Populum	It's a basic human right. People deserve it for being born into a society- the same way most of us agree that people deserve a police force, and firefighters, and clean water, and basic education, and social security, and all of the other things that we pay for with our taxes.
Ad Populum	My particular religion is the most popular in the world. That fits the secular view that some will be lead astray, but most will be saved. Also makes it the most likely to be true.
Ad Populum	Delusional means that your understanding of reality doesnt match up with the truth  If they have that many followers, and are able to sell their work, nothing is delusional about it.
Ad Populum	Lack of allies.

Ad Populum	The majority of americans believe in a JFK conspiracy so 
Ad Populum	"&gt;but calling him cult leader is asinine.   Far too many people have pointed out the clear correlations between Drumpf and other cult leaders for such a comparison to be denigrated as ""asinine"".  From:   [https://www.rollcall.com/news/politics/mark-sanford-trump-cult-personality](https://www.rollcall.com/news/politics/mark-sanford-trump-cult-personality)   &gt; GOP Rep. Mark Sanford issued a blistering rebuke of President Donald Trump over the weekend, saying the president is autocratic in style and that Republicans are at risk of becoming a cult of personality around the mercurial leader of the free world."
Ad Populum	*Checks numbers of people who consider it possible*  Survey says you are wrong.
Ad Populum	I think traditions that aren't vegan are good because worldwide no one eats only plants. Only the 1% or less do, and they are brainwashed into an delusional cult called veganism/vegetarianism. Those top 99% or so realize it is malnourishment which is why almost all people worldwide are omnivores, not herbivores. Wake up.
Ad Populum	You cant just disagree on a fact. Just look up the most bingewatched shows. Both Friends and the office are in there.
Ad Populum	YTA- he deleted the server because of something you did. Everyone thinks it's your fault so it probably is. Normally when everybody thinks it, it's probably so.

Ad Populum	Ahdjdjshshrrjenrhrhrbhr  They do know the majority of the country believed he lied under oath, right???  I fucking.... Ugh.
Ad Populum	I would say the fact that your comment is hidden by downvotes that no one cares what you think in this regard.
Ad Populum	I love the GOP idea that the opinion of the coasts don't count despite that the majority of Americans live on the coasts.  More people live in NYC and LA than most of the other states combined, so the opinion of NYC and LA is more valid than that of the other states.
Ad Populum	I would tell you that this is the Great-Grandfather of all claims. And there are a billion people who share this claim. That can't we ignored, right?
Ad Populum	Almost everyone in the world will look more favorably on a person who has had sex 100x times with one person versus having sex 1x each with 100 different people.  As they should.
Ad Populum	Throughout all of human history,  and still currently today the majority of people believe in a higher power that they actually can interact with.   Logic would suggest that there is something to investigate,  dismissing it as a coping mechanism is a poor argument.
Ad Populum	I know right, those 2k people must be pretty embarrassed right now.
Ad Populum	"Yes, I'd be so much more at ease with Scheer ""let's all vote in person"" at the helm.  Canadians overwhelmingly approve of both the fed and provincial response to this, the stinking ichor and vitriol is all you."
Ad Populum	Why would you treat your personal expensive electronics with less care than you would a display item...?  The idea of you break it you buy it is even more apparent in items youve *already bought*    Also can we quit it with this why do you insist on defending a trillion dollar company bullshit? Just because a company is worth a trillion dollars doesnt mean any and all attacks or criticism can no longer be defended against...  if I think youre wrong Im going to say it and explain why I think that. I dont care if its Facebook Im defending or the mom and pop store down the block.   
Ad Populum	"No clue what your point is. Literally nobody contested that slaves or slavery existed in 1850.   ""Wage slavery"" is a term that most people either believe in nor find credible outside of the socialist religion. "

Rest of the world's response: ""That's tragic, how do we fix this?"" "
Ad Populum	You can say the same for reddit users, Facebook users, YouTube users. They all display your chosen username. There are also many multiplayer pvp games that use real usernames. Like words with friends, chess, etc.
Ad Populum	"What a strange time we live in socially. It definitely seems like in the past 12 months, people have become exponentially more conscious of social biases and issues affecting men. I've been an ""MRA"" for years, and I always knew this would happen. The whole perception of the men's rights movement is very distorted and misunderstood...there's no connection to anything like the incel movement, it's just to talk about things like this."
Ad Populum	Awww triggered the fascist. The age of consent is 16 throughout much of the world.  You're the one whose ideas of when it's appropriate to allow people to have sex is out of touch with the rest of humanity.    Pathetic.  Fascists love controlling people anyway they can.
Ad Populum	I would argue that a deity which does not have any active human followers is functionally irrelevant, whether it exists or  not.
Ad Populum	Socialism cant be that bad if a socialist is on the verge of becoming the Democratic nominee and this sub is silent.
Ad Populum	It's only closed temporarily to celebrate reaching 69420 subs.   Which is 62k more than you, I guess. 
Ad Populum	If somebody said this in 1950, would you come to the same conclusion? If not, then clearly this conclusion is contingent on the actual social oppression that is happening to these groups. So now we are right back at the start where the argument becomes about whether minority groups face disproportionate oppression.   Academics who study this are in broad consensus that there is disproportionate oppression facing certain groups across many facets of life.
Ad Populum	nah fam all that shit was true. Good luck cherry picking your facts tho since pretty much the entire internet agrees that USSR killed millions!

Ad Populum	I disagree with every comment on this thread.  Almost 3k upvotes show that most people agree with me. A furry is not something Ive ever seen in real life and I would not even know the term existed if not for these strange Reddit posts/comments.  Its weird, its not socially or mentally healthy, its not a thing.  Bring on the downvotes. 
Ad Populum	There are valid reasons to be both Catholic and support legalized abortion.   Studies show that abortions occur just as frequently in nations where it is legal as nations where it is not.   Nations with no legal abortions have higher rates of unsafe abortions, maternal death, and female teen suicide.  We must care about the health and life of women too. These women are at their lowest and need compassion and safety.  If restricting and banning abortion doesn't lower the rates of abortions, but instead causes more harm and death, it is not a good policy.   https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2018/04/05/amid-new-talk-of-criminalizing-abortion-research-shows-dangers-for-women/  Choosing compassion over virtue signaling should not place any individual in mortal sin.  After all, 51% of US Catholics believe abortion should be legal in all or most cases.   http://www.pewforum.org/fact-sheet/public-opinion-on-abortion/

Ad Populum	Of course, but im sure the majority hate tanks
Ad Populum	I could probably name at least a dozen million people that would disagree
Ad Populum	Inarguably, this would make sense if we're discussing Mormonism or Scientology. However, Judaism and Christianity has taken a foothold over oceans of populations for its veracity in the eyes who behold the truths in the form of finding it to turn out to make more sense than not at all. It is easier to believe God have the 10 commandments at Mt. Sinai, and many people witnessed Moses coming down shining in bright white light, so much so that the tradition to this day globally is that that indeed happened and an entire nation witnessed it, that is how the whole world came to hear of it, unlike Scientology unable to reach Poland or parts of the Earth Christianity and Judaism has.
Ad Populum	Generally speaking if numerous beliefs that are all conflicting in various ways all agree on something that holds a lot of weight.
Ad Populum	Post in both club and MLS subreddits. Let upvotes decide what is relevant, IMO
Ad Populum	Russia wrong?  How about Iran and China?  It can't be the entire world is wrong
Ad Populum	What is that suppose to mean? The President and his team are handling this better than any other administration would. Things are bad but they would be a lot worse if we had bad or incompetent people handling this. The polls show more people approve of Trump's handling of this than disapprove. So you are in the minority on this one. Maybe gets your news from somewhere other than the liberal media.
Ad Populum	It is a housewife thing. Look it up. Actually many commenters on the ad cited the sexism issue. Im just appalled the dudes at twillory approved the video.
Ad Populum	There's a reason why your opinion is unpopular
Ad Populum	&gt; Second of all, those are poor arguments.   That's just, like, your opinion, man.   &gt; You have demonstrated that you lack an understanding of Jewish law when interpreting conversion and the Sabbath   Nowhere in the old testament is the conversion process outlined. The minutia regarding the Sabbath were concocted by Rabbis long after Moses received the Torah. They have no basis in the bible.   &gt; Can that logic not be used to claim that anyone is the messiah?  Except in Jesus' case he is believed to be the Messiah by almost 4 billion people. (2 billion Christians and 1.8 billion Muslims).   If that's not a sign that he's the messiah then I don't think anything will convince the Jews.
Ad Populum	Evidence for a god comes in many different forms. There's nothing fucked up about believing in a higher power. Plenty of famous and influential scientists believed that their work was evidence of god indisputably, while others believe it's the opposite. Just a point of view no reason to call it fucked up or oust people for it
Ad Populum	The Bible has outsold every book in existence by millions of copies. Only God's word could achieve such a miracle. You know it in your heart, don't suppress the truth in unrighteousness brother. I will pray for you.  Blessings

Ad Populum	Funny how many reviewers trip over each other trying to say the same things while forgetting that the same critiques were said about each Bethesda open world game since Oblivion, and ignoring that sales are continuing to rise.   At some point you'd think critics would see their view isn't matching reality...
Ad Populum	You may disagree with your husband, and that is perfectly legitimate, but you have to acknowledge he is not being unreasonable at all.  But it seems you are so determined to be ''open-minded'' and ''progressive'', that you're willing to enter a serious conflict with your husband over something that roughly half of population would support him in.  So be it.
Ad Populum	That's why they're currently the most successful social platform.
Ad Populum	Rightly so. I don't care how it makes trans people feel, the vast majority of people would want to know if someone was born a different sex to that which they're passing themselves off as.
Ad Populum	You really need to ask yourself whether it's more important for you to feel like you're right about ths one thing, or if it's more important to get the best experience for the buck.  If you really think you're smarter than the aggregate wisdom of hundreds of people who have built desktop and laptop systems for years, that's your own problem. If there's some external factor going into your desire for a gaming laptop (parent might pay for it, university, etc.), that's something that's OK to admit - it would definitely change my decision too.  At the very least if you're going to argue against this much authority you'll need decisive argument and overwhelming evidence. Until then, please trust our authority and logic on this topic. We have no reason to lie to you. 
Ad Populum	"The ME (as in the Effect) is real, to those who experience it.    To anyone who doesn't experience the Effect - it should be apparent enough that the Effect itself is real, just by way of the large numbers of people reporting that they DO experience it. That the Effect exists shouldn't in my opinion be a matter of contention.    It's the Cause *behind* the effect which has the potential to be the more interesting argument - even if it were to transpire that the Cause *was* simply people misremembering stuff. As a for what it's worth, I don't believe ""misremembering"" is the cause at all. It's something else... "
Ad Populum	Since so many philosophers do tend towards physicalism, perhaps you should consider that it's not so clumsy a view.  Perhaps you should read what they have to say about it so that you might understand why it's coherent.  
Ad Populum	Have none of you worked at a mall before? I've seen pottery barn literally turn away a shipment and have the truck dump everything into the dumpster because they have no room for any of it.Every store does this with things they can't sell.   Yeah, I agree that donating this stuff would be a the right thing to do but It won't happen as it would be seen as something that could devalue the product they are still trying to sell.  Edit: Forgot the best part, employees are fired if they take the shit from the garbage too

Ad Populum	I think everyone agrees the retirement age can and should gradually be moved forward. I think stopping at 67.5. Over the appropriate time frame, it will increase the working age population, boost productivity, and delay social security payments.

Ad Populum	I'm extrapolating based on Dr. Peterson's anecdotes of personal encounters with fans, times the fact the book is a bestseller and has yet to peak, times the nature of the book as a defense of Western civ.  I could be wrong, but time will tell.
Ad Populum	Actually that's an old number today it's over 99%
Ad Populum	84% of the entire worlds population believe in some God.   Christianity is a third of that. Im not sure if that number accounts for all denominations that worship Jesus (Baptist, Methodist, non denominational and so on.) Also Catholics are considered a different religion but believe in the same God as Christians. Jews also believe in the same God as Christians, they just dont believe in Jesus as the son of God.    Aside from that point, my question is this: if 84% of the entire world believes in at least one God or another. Why do you think there isnt one. I mean, Im Christian, but obviously people follow other religions than mine.   So 84% of the world are weak minded? Seems like a crazier idea to hold that there is no God, than it is to believe in a God.    
Ad Populum	Imagine thinking random YouTube conspiracy videos are more reliable sources than the thousands of actual scientists studying every aspect of the climate.

Ad Populum	Tell that to the 1.2 billion Roman catholics.
Ad Populum	There were many in ancient Greece and Rome who claimed to be prophets and messiahs. All of their followers fell away because they discovered the truth.  Jesus's followers believed unto their own deaths, often because of their faith. The reason we know the name of Jesus and not the false prophets and messiahs is because His followers never fell away, but kept witnessing.
Ad Populum	I don't know if my sensory data accurately represents reality. However, if we are to compare my sensory data and prophetic claims, mine is at least very consistent with most interpretations of the universe, which is why I treat prophetic claims with more suspicion than my own sensory data.
Ad Populum	> Trump supporters for the most part aren't too bright.  Yay! Lets keep calling 60 million voters stupid!!!   Surely that is a sound opinion from an intelligent person.
Ad Populum	And so did everybody else.  This stuff is more common than most people realize.  
Ad Populum	 forgot to mention, you have a reason to live, even if it is not happiness. so clearly people can have reasons to live regardless of suffering. you yourself are proof of that. and when will this become reality is not known and i know some people who are planning on a having 1 so no. as someone educated on the subject, i'd be very surprised if we couldn't do it in 50 years. i would actually be surprised if the first experimental case wasn't within 15 years. no i am saying that its easier to convince ugly people not to have kids other than the avg. joe. what does being ugly have to do with it? no i argue that life has alot of suffering and to put that upon people is bad. you haven't argued that at all, you've claimed it, but you haven't argued it. most people are not suicidal, clearly the fast majority doesn't agree with you.

Ad Populum	"I have found that instead of giving counterpoints, frame it in a question. So if I am debating someone about climate change, I'll say ""over 90% of the scientific community believes that climate change is happening and that humans are the main cause of it.

By framing my counterpoints as questions, it creates a situation where their answers might challenge me and let my understanding of an issue advance."

Ad Populum	But I would still say I don't like it, and you would still not like it, and most people would agree that they didn't like. It would still be the case that most people would think it was bad. So you would still have laws against it and it would be considered wrong *subject to society* which is the more meaningful thing imo
Tradition Fallacy	"Honestly dumbest post ever, stopped reading 2 sentences in. F-keys has always been a part of the game, yet downloading a script or making one to allow for you to do stuff quicker never was. The mouse keys on operating systems are only good for dropping stuff and dont have any use beyond that whereas people were using AHK to do stuff so far much faster than anyone without them could. You call this efficiency, I call this bullshit - now, if your mentality here is ""If you want to be better at the game, you need to download this"", that idea alone is flawed. Every game has something that you can download to do better at it, but most of it is referred to as cheating - scripting in League or Dota, OpenGL scripts in CS 1.6, custom models in any shooter for easier opponent detection etc."
Tradition Fallacy	A dog is a domesticated animal, which has been used for home protection and companionship for centuries. Pigs are food source animals and have been farmed and used as such for centuries as well. There is no comparison, they are two completely different situations.

Tradition Fallacy	But Star Wars is not Marvel. Its great that we get 1 movie every year, but the nature of Star Wars is slower. Jeremy Jahn said it perfectly. Star Wars has always had 3 years between each movie, to develop the story and be creative. When JJ Abrams says that he has finished the script to IX already, that worries me.

Tradition Fallacy	Item dots have been a staple of the series since Super Metroid. They're there to help you, either, remember the location or know that there is a hidden item. But they never reveal the location of it.  The Scan Pulse does that but it's never forced on you.  Man, people have been getting so damn nitpicky lately.  Let's also get rid of item sounds in Prime, the Scan Visor and suspicious looking walls, too.
Tradition Fallacy	"By ""so long""do you mean ""from day 1"" as random crits were desjgned into the game from the start.

Tradition Fallacy	I disagree with this post. Im all for veganism, but im not going to set any belief on my future children other than a strong moral compass. What they choose to eat, play, think or believe in is up to them.  Do i think not feeding children meat is okay? Honestly no. Humans are made to get nutrients we need from meat and plants. Were omnivores. Yes butchering animals and slaughterhouses exist. But me not buying meat isnt going to change that. Weve been raising and killing animals since the dawn of time and agriculture.  Eating another organism has and always will be the natural way of life. I will not indoctrinate my kids into any system of belief. Does that mean I feed them lunchables? No, but this kind of post is
Tradition Fallacy	I think it is a false equivalence - there's a reason most modern societies don't eat dogs. We domesticated wolves for a purpose - to live alongside us, protect our flocks and in today's world bring joy and companionship in mutually beneficial relationships. We don't fuck our sisters not because of incestuous inbreeding in today's world but because that's not how we function, or should function. We may be genetically pre-disposed to not be attracted to our siblings, but we also know it is inherently wrong as members of society, no matter how arbitrary the constructs may be. The same applies to roasting a dog - it is acceptable in some cultures but certainly not in the way PETA is trying to make their point.   I have nothing against vegans or veganism in general but stupid fucking arguments with shock-tactics will not serve PETA's purposes. 
Tradition Fallacy	Why? I mean we have been slaughtering animals since the beginning of the human race, why do people think that this is wrong now? I agree that the meat industry is not very ethical but if we all went vegan wouldn't we just find an unethical way to grow vegetables too if the demand was to be so high? Mass genocide is the only way *snaps fingers* sorry wrong reddit
Tradition Fallacy	Why is this continuously debated on Reddit? America has a tipping culture. I understand that other parts of the globe do not. America does. Its not *stupid*. Its a part of the culture. 
Tradition Fallacy	&gt;ridiculous preferred norms  TIL norms that were in place for thousands of years of history until just the last few years are ridiculous
Tradition Fallacy	A) Sorry were at the top of the food chain? Sorry that we kill animals to eat? Weve eaten animals for hundreds of years and nobodys had an issue with it.   B) So is drinking alcohol and a plethora of other things that I do, but do I care? Not particularly. Im only here for a short stint of time compared to the larger picture. Doesnt matter if I live 20 years or 60 years.   C) Sure it might be bad for the environment, but theres plenty more that does way worse. Example- Manufacturing in China.
Tradition Fallacy	Im sorry but its just tradition for the man to pay for dinner especially in a date situation. I find it outrageous that he would suggest a place that was going to be over $500 after tip and expect to split the bill.
Tradition Fallacy	I wonder what happened to our ancestors who were unwilling to work?
Tradition Fallacy	Horses have been part of humanity's armies all the way until WW1. That's part of their contract with humans.  Our contract with dogs is similar.
Tradition Fallacy	Its endgame content, and power should matter in endgame content.  Its the way its always been.  Posts like these is what makes the game worse
Tradition Fallacy	Leather is and has been used for centuries now. It was an essential resource to keep certain groups of people throughout history warm, and was also used as currency in some places or trade material. Its been very valuable throughout history and the world. Dont let other peoples opinions get you down - in leather and in life! Opinions are like assholes - everyones got one lol
Tradition Fallacy	Buu buuu but if I dont work ILL STATVE MUH TENDIESSSS MAKONF ME WORF 4 FOOD MAKE ME EH VICTEMN  Watching them throw a hissy fit when they find out working to survive has how its been since the dawn of time is painful as if they honestly thought food just fell into the laps of our ancestors
Tradition Fallacy	Youre paying for the credits and the degree. Thats always been the case.
Tradition Fallacy	I couldn't agree more. The Myth of Progress that Chesterton dealt with in his day has evolved to the modern world when it should have been killed in the trenches of WW1 and the bombs of WW2. Progress for it's own sake is cancerous, indeed it is the very idea that creates biological cancers. Truth is unchanging and traditions often are answers and responses to these unchanging truths. This is not to say that tradition is infallible or that all traditions are meritorious, but we should not be so quick to label them outdated them just because they are old.
Tradition Fallacy	"Ah the old, ""if you can't afford to tip well, you shouldn't go out to eat"" gambit. Or how about ""if you can't understand that people tip based on the quality of their service and 15% has always been appropriate"" you shouldn't be a waiter ploy?"
Tradition Fallacy	If it were the cultural norm, they'd eat cats and dogs too.
Tradition Fallacy	Some of its opinion some of it is tradition but some few words I think lines up with it is strong, protector, warrior, responsible, disciplined, kind, decisive, strategic and willing to sacrifice. Which of course women can carry these qualities but we compliment each other in what the other is lacking for balance.
Tradition Fallacy	It is not hatred; it is an incessant, perpetual gnawing of discontent with modernity.   Conversely, legitimate hatred and the slow (albeit impactful) forward march of secular progressivism go hand-in-hand.
Tradition Fallacy	Social Club has been around since 2008 or so and you had to make an account to play most R\* games anyway.  &amp;#x200B;  Most people who cry about launchers are a bunch of idiots, honestly. Good thing they're a minority, though.
Tradition Fallacy	44 presidents have invoked God in their inaugural address. President Obama is the only exception. 
Tradition Fallacy	Sex with minors is a man made taboo/crime. It was common before the industrial revolution. Just sayin
Tradition Fallacy	Traditions are not ours to give away for no good reason, they belong to our ancestors and our descendants. 
Tradition Fallacy	I'm really not amused by this, or the string of terrible suggestions regarding closing up the gap downstream. What's wrong with having one? Has F1 ever had ten or eleven teams fighting for podiums before? If they want close racing so much, fuck F1 and fuck development let's just go the way of Indycar. Better yet, let's just hand everyone a trophy and be done with it. We're all champs. Fuck yeah.  Sorry about the rant I just have to let it out. This just sounds extremely unfair to the top teams. Sometimes I think liberty is trying too hard.
Tradition Fallacy	And what do you think about people not being sure if feeding a child that type of diet is safe yet? In that I mean people saying it's better to stay with the diet used on most children since the first human like creatures.
Tradition Fallacy	**Context:** Donald Trump has now gone the longest time without holding a formal press conference of any president within the [last half century.](https://www.thedailybeast.com/president-trumps-new-record-the-longest-time-without-a-formal-press-conference-in-half-a-century) Trump's first and only formal press conference was given 3 weeks after his inauguration compared with Barack Obama who had held 11 solo press conferences within his first year in office.
Tradition Fallacy	Canada has been a resource based country since it's inception. 
Tradition Fallacy	Found a vegan complaining about the process that created their ability to think in the first place. Rypical.
Tradition Fallacy	It's ok to eat animals. We've done it a long time, it helped us to evolve. What's not ok, is to treat them poorly because they are food.    
Tradition Fallacy	"Is this actually a problem so large that we need to uproot a societal custom thousands of years old?  This is basically the argument of ""Oh shit I have a splinter... may as well cut that finger off"""
Tradition Fallacy	Its a part of the culture 
Tradition Fallacy	It fundamentally goes against the core family values on which modern civilized cultures are based on, so I disagree.
Tradition Fallacy	But it does work it has worked for like thousands of years...
Tradition Fallacy	YTA, it's a social expectation by default even if it's not perfect in 2019.  If she offers to split it out or pay for it, be pleasantly surprised.
Tradition Fallacy	Why do you hate Islamic culture? This is their way of life. Who are we to try and change it?
Tradition Fallacy	Because it transcends emotion. it is about nature. Humans are animals and more specifically: homosapiens. And homosapiens have from when we first became homosapiens ate meat to survive and get the nutrients required to live. It is beyond selfish acts.
Tradition Fallacy	Marriage for love is a recent western concept. It's fairly chauvinistic to just say it's preferable to systems that have existed for thousand of years.
Tradition Fallacy	Trash talking has been been a part of gaming/entertainment in a long time now. People just get offended easily nowadays. Like you
Tradition Fallacy	It is. I see no point. Humans have been driving for almost 120 years why cant we keep driving ourselves?
Tradition Fallacy	About 90% of the worlds population eats meat. I buy the argument that we can get by without it, but I dont buy that absent that change, were eating meat only for gustatory pleasure and not for sustenance. The vast majority of people are simply obtaining sustenance the way that theyve been taught, eating food and using recipes that have been passed down for generations. They probably would survive as vegetarians, but that doesnt mean that the reason their eating meat is just for pleasure.
Tradition Fallacy	Its not healthy to be vegan. Humans have eaten meat forever. We should continue to do what has kept our species alive for so long.
Tradition Fallacy	Except not in the way most people think, and certainly not in a manner that will be addressed by neoliberal policies masked as progressive.  Automation has been disrupting our world since tailors smashed sewing machines. Hell, it has been since the dawn of agriculture. It has not, ever, led to long-term, massive unemployment. What it has led to is wealth inequity. That's what needs to be addressed.
Tradition Fallacy	Eh, my great great relatives killed confederates, grandfather killed nazis, least I can do as a patriot is punch a nazi
Tradition Fallacy	From /r/castiron newbie FAQ.  Soap - Can it stay or does it go? Congratulations! You hit the #1 contested issue with cast iron. Should you use soap? But there really is no reason not to use today's mild dish soap. Dish soap today, such as Dawn, doesn't contain the same type of chemicals (such as lye) as it did 100 years ago when you were not supposed to use soap on cast iron. In fact it would be more accurate to say that today's dish soap is really dish detergent. Feel free to use if you want. Full disclosure, I don't use soap on my cast iron. I don't because my mother didn't and her mother didn't etc, but that's just me, and it's up to you if you want to use it yourself.
Tradition Fallacy	Eh, that kind of seems like it would be over complicating a problem that already has a solution. You just have to preheat your teaware with hot water before brewing. That's the way people have been doing if for hundreds of years at least.
Tradition Fallacy	You wouldn't be alive right now if your ancestors didn't eat meat and evolve. Bit hypocritical.
Tradition Fallacy	Exclusives have been a part of video games since the beginning. They're not going to go away unless there is a major change in the landscape of video games.

Tradition Fallacy	Bullshit, football has included politics from the damn beginning whether you like it or not. Theyre not going anywhere, you can choose to ignore them. 
Tradition Fallacy	"""they"" has been used as a singular so ce the 13th century and appears in the work of poets like Chaucer and Shakespeare.  Sorry"
Tradition Fallacy	people have always been poor as a mater of fact other times in history it's been worse, 1930s and 70s were pretty bad.
Tradition Fallacy	Why? Horses and donkeys have been used for that purpose for millennia. 
Tradition Fallacy	No, thats been that picture forever.  I say leave it.  Its not even the pictures fault the sub isnt cursed anymore.  
Tradition Fallacy	I think the difference is blatantly obvious. The top group are wild animals in the brink of extinction while the bottom group are livestocks, domesticated animal that are bred for the sole purpose of food and other commodities such as leather, eggs, milk or wool.   You vegans love to go back to the argument that they are the same fundamentally, they are all animals. And you are right, I am not challenging this fact what so ever.  But somehow, being vegan also shuts down your innate sense to think about things in a logical and rational manner. These animals are bred and have been since the agricultural revolution for the sole purpose of food, you are here today protesting against the consumption of these animals because these same animals were eaten by your distant ancestors.   And why dont we eat dogs?  Do I even need to answer that?
Tradition Fallacy	The monarchy is part of living history. I think it's important to preserve historic institutions. Tradition is what gives out culture texture.
Tradition Fallacy	People lived in worse for most of civilisations history.
Tradition Fallacy	Just goes to show how Looney those types are. Humans have been eating animals for tens of thousands of years.
Tradition Fallacy	I would agree with you if we havent been driving rail cars for centuries now.
Tradition Fallacy	It tastes good, I grew up with it, its natural, hunting is instinctual, I only kill in the most humane way possible so the animal doesn't suffer
Tradition Fallacy	&gt; They were in fact seeking a better life from an economic perspective. &gt;  &gt;   So when the early europeans did it it was ok but not now?
Tradition Fallacy	And there it is, the vegan plug just waiting to crawl out of the woodwork and use a natural disaster to wag it's finger at me for eating the same food humans have been eating for millennia.
Tradition Fallacy	While I wouldnt eat a bat or snake myself, I dont see anything wrong with that if the culture has always eaten those animals. In the west, the majority of people see nothing wrong with eating cows and pigs. Theyre all animals at the end of the day and the human species has been eating them for a very long time.  I guess Im trying to say I fail to see the issue here and this always comes across as xenophobic to me.
Tradition Fallacy	No, for 99.9% of our species history we have never had a steady supply of calories. No species apart from us ever has. Do you really think we would evolve to suffer from something that all species go through?
Tradition Fallacy	"Everyone in here complaining about killing animals for food needs to chill. It's a normal part of life and has been for centuries, don't be like the fucking American ""left"" and purity test people out of your ideology."
Tradition Fallacy	"In high school, I took a philosophy course and one of the topics was the cultural differences in ethics. There was another student who actually argued that male-male rape should be seen as ""normal"" and accepted, since it's been happening for thousands of years.   I then told her that I should be allowed murder her, since it's been happening since the dawn of man - she didn't understand my argument hahah"

Tradition Fallacy	&gt; Carolina wins their division  It would be truly crazy for the team that won their  division 3 out of the last 4 years to win it again. 
Tradition Fallacy	How is eating meat bad? We humans have done it since our time began and will continue until we die. 
Tradition Fallacy	Cooking and eating meat is an artistic practice with thousands of years of history. My choice to cook and eat meat is a choice to participate in the continuation of this art form. I support eating meat for the same reason I would support classical music, theater, or sculpture: because I support art. And I am generally skeptical of attempts at soft censorship of this art by shaming meat eaters.
Tradition Fallacy	"I would like to see an increased respawn time in FFA to deincentivize ""suicide by proxy"" as you put it, as well as otherwise sacc-ing in.  In it's current form, FFA comes down to whoever bots in the most time-effeciently.  They should double the armor dropped on death. Recovering stack isn't realistic in its current state where 8 players have to share 3 armors on the map.  I feel that would be a better solution than your ""stack refund"" idea, which doesn't feel like a natural mechanic for an arena shooter."
Tradition Fallacy	do you think ancient artists were good people? like, do you think michelangelo or the ancient greeks or the ancient chinese artists were nice, wholesome people who were nice to their friends and never raped women... if so, get real. they were probably mostly monsters because almost all humans were monsters then.   but their art is eternal. it doesnt really have anything to do with them as humans, it's the art.
Tradition Fallacy	Whats the logic, weve been eating meat since the beginning of human existence
Tradition Fallacy	Classic white people demanding the indigenous population to stop a cultural practice that has existed for thousands of years.
Tradition Fallacy	Well they can just confirm the lies and yeah torture has been used for a long time so yeah it does work
Tradition Fallacy	You realize that killing things and eating them has been a staple of life since the dawn of time right?
Tradition Fallacy	"Ideal, perhaps for some. However it is highly unrealistic. Mankind has been using ""recreational drugs"" since we developed agriculture, and probably before too."
Tradition Fallacy	Who cares if it was hit with lead shot? It has been used for a very, very long time. I'm going to assume that you are asking this in regards to bird hunting. Any part of the animal that the lead projectile passes through, you likely will not consume, because it will have blood shot. Cut the blood shot out, and don't worry about it.
Tradition Fallacy	what's your point? credit unions have historically served defined groups of people.
Tradition Fallacy	>there's a good historical consensus for this  Marriage law is well over 2,000 years old. What is the historical consensus for lack of government involvement in marriage?  
Tradition Fallacy	Atheism.  Yeah, I said it. Even if you don't believe in the Christian god, I don't see how you can't believe in supernatural. I mean, if a majority of the human race has believed in some sort of supernatural force for as long as we have, I wouldn't immediately want to call bullshit on everything they've been saying. 
Tradition Fallacy	it's 14 because that's just how it is
Tradition Fallacy	Reddit totes itself as a free speech site and the admins have no business being biased against certain times of speech if they want to maintain that image. People being rude online is part of internet culture, and it's been that way since the internet was made available to the general public. It is a part of our internet heritage, and cupcake here has no business telling us what we should and shouldn't do. 
Tradition Fallacy	Weber's is a Tulsa tradition!
Tradition Fallacy	Why lol? That's how it has always been
Tradition Fallacy	Not sure why you're so outraged that a newspaper endorsed a political candidate in its editorial pages. This is a tradition that has gone back since 1860 in [the New York Times' case](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/10/28/opinion/presidential-endorsement-timeline.html).
Tradition Fallacy	Yeah let's take 100 years of tradition and put some pads there instead. 
Tradition Fallacy	It's been there for more than a decade. It won't stop now. 
Tradition Fallacy	Hmmm...let me think about this...my options are to trust 2000 years worth of Christian thinking, or trust the singular oddities of what you are saying.  Yeah, pretty sure I'll stick with Christianity.
Tradition Fallacy	A woman that age is sexually mature.  In all other species, individuals start reproducing at that stage.    There are many native cultures that still marry girls off not long after they've reached physical maturity.    
Tradition Fallacy	But we've. Even doing that forever, it's not a thing for our era alone
Tradition Fallacy	The monarchy is our heritage without we have no past, no history its a reminder of where we came from. God save the Queen 
Tradition Fallacy	Fuck off with this BS,  Humans have no less right to eat meat than a Lion or Wolf does.   We have evidence that humans have been eating meat since prior to recorded history.    
Tradition Fallacy	This is a ridiculous post and this mechanic will never be changed. Seat switching has always been a BF mechanic. Dont sit here and try and talk about realism or how you shouldnt be able to swap instantly between seats when there is hardly anything realistic about BF vehicle play in general. Sounds like you need to get better if you are having trouble shooting down the most vulnerable aircraft in the sky.
Tradition Fallacy	Hmmm it's almost like dogs are culturally significant as companions in our culture but cows are not
Tradition Fallacy	This place has ALWAYS been shit posts unless it's streaming. Best to unsub and keep an eye out for when it goes live. You'll Thank me later
Tradition Fallacy	You should consider trying to understand something with so much history and intricacy before you knock it blindly and encourage human injury. Its an animal, and not even a useful one, relax.
Tradition Fallacy	I hate this authoritarianism. Weve always had an open fire at the family house around Christmas and it wont be the same without real coal.
Tradition Fallacy	"So why haven't governments adopted it for policing citizens? I think pretty much every society still has a ""punish when you fuck up"" mindset."
Tradition Fallacy	Yes, I would. I am not attracted to uncircumcised penises. It's just what I'm used to. All my brothers are circumcised (4 brothers) and I just would. I guess it's tradition, but its not just because of that. I can't really explain why. I would do it when they were infants, so they wouldn't remember the pain. My parents pierced my ears when I was 3 mo's old and I'm grateful I don't remember the pain, that's why I haven't gotten another piercing.
Tradition Fallacy	"Essentially you're asking for pain reports by patients and those are always subjective regardless of the study or where it's published. Journals contain many articles with claims along the lines of: ""...patients report experiencing less pain with X..."". Some may argue with me, but all of the those papers are garbage. Pain is subjective and therefore impossible to gauge.   If chiro had no effect then the profession would have died out long ago. Traumatic injury causing back pain may never heal properly so the course of post-traumatic treatment will have little long-term efficacy in warding off a later recurrance of pain. Not doctors, chiropractors, massage therapists or persons offering any other techniques can guarantee that pain will not return. All that matters is that the treatment fits the immediate needs of the person and has the greatest short-term efficacy. If the treatment has a long-term effect then that's a plus.     "
Tradition Fallacy	So its unbalanced now because she became popular? She has this spell since ever, its silly to call it unbalace 
Tradition Fallacy	Does John Oliver expect a military to positively identify every single enemy causality in war?  A standard held to exactly zero wars ever.
Tradition Fallacy	"> In the United States at least, our legal system has developed to be based on a mostly consequentialist system of ethics. Being against LGBT equality does not fall into that realm since there are no objective reasons to be against it.  Who says Christians have to follow ""American"" ethics? How can you be so positive that you know what true American ethics truly are, considering homosexual marriage wasn't legalized for most of American history?"
Tradition Fallacy	> It's not anti Christian because you can be Christian and affirming.  According to *your* theology. It is heresy to historical Christianity. So, no, people do have theological reasons.
Tradition Fallacy	A start, but we really need to get immigration levels back to historical levels. We dont need more than 300,000 people a year coming to our over crowded cities, road and hospitals that just cant cope with the influx of people. Until muslims embrace western society and respect for women i dont see why we let them come here. 
Tradition Fallacy	Lobbying has been around since the country was founding and defended in the original federalist papers due to being protected by the first amendment 
Tradition Fallacy	I disagree with the government handing out a $1000/month check to everyone.  We the people didnt set up a government to provide a $1000 check each month to everyone.  The US government was set up to protect life, liberty and property.  We the people are supposed to take care of ourselves, not rely on the government.
Tradition Fallacy	It's always been the editors choice. Stop whining.
Tradition Fallacy	"Funny, but it isn't the same. Why? Because it doesn't have the *temporus qualitus*. Yes I just made up that term. 2000 years of tradition gives it credibility. Tradition is the transmission of culture, knowledge, behavior; from the Latin root for ""transmit"". It's along this line of reasoning that modern-day prophets (or ""Second Comings"" for some people) are so rarely accepted.  **EDIT:** Not appealing to tradition. Not saying time makes a belief inherently true. Not saying that any belief system should be followed. I'm merely saying that this is how it is. Human culture over time is one giant-ass, often ridiculous, game of Telephone."
Tradition Fallacy	Anyone else getting tired of Canada's perpetual campaign of boosting its own pride at the expense of the US? Canadians claim they don't have an inferiority complex, yet all they seem to do is bash the US and praise Canada. They create pride at the expense of the US, it seems there's no other way.   And of course, most Canadians are so unaccustomed to hearing criticism and so adverse to it that they are going to mobilize against my post, and downvote it into oblivion.  Meanwhile, the US constitution is roughly 200 years older. It is the oldest surviving democratic constitution in existence. And it actually influenced Canada's Charter of Rights and Freedoms. So I really don't understand all this hoopla from Canadians. 
Tradition Fallacy	Depends On the time scale you consider - There is a counter side to this  Brewing has a particularly interesting history intertwined with human development.   1.  It actually saved the lives of millions by allowing people to survive contaminated water sources, which is why it was so important in civilizations back to Mesopotamia   2. Bottling started the industrial revolution - which has led to huge improvements in human standard of living and increase in population.  3.  Many historians think that it was brewing which first led to people abandoning hunter/gatherer lifestyles, expanding human interaction between tribes and discover farming. I don't know how many extra people lived as a reslt of this - but it is a pretty big number.  It seems ridiculous to have people calling to ban something that people are known to have used since Mesopotamia's first cities  
Tradition Fallacy	Ah, but that wasn't during our country's existence. America's definition of marriage has been pretty consistent with modern christianity. I understand your position, but it's easily argued against in the practical.
Tradition Fallacy	Vegans who decide not to eat meat for personal or health reasons, I'm okay with. Vegans who try to convert other people by preaching that meat is murder, I'm not okay with. We've been doing this for thousands of years; I think we'll be okay. 
Tradition Fallacy	Marriage has been part of the government for thousands of years. It would make no sense to separate it now. 
Tradition Fallacy	lol its a funny video but still does not change that fact that marriage was between man and woman
Tradition Fallacy	Not a single good reason? Oh, come on. How about the fact that Gay Marriage is entirely unprecedented in America? Literally, cellphones, computers, and the internet are all older than the institution of Gay Marriage in this country. Aren't supporters of Gay Marriage imposing their will on everybody else when they say that this quite recent concept should be the law of the land?
Tradition Fallacy	I have no idea. Prior generations grew up just fine without being glued to a screen all the time, so I don't know why it's a requirement today.
Tradition Fallacy	"yea it should be ""so you really believe people who've smoked it for thousands of years got it wrong, and in 1937 a banana bunch of corrupt politicians got it right?"""
Tradition Fallacy	When you put it like that you make him sound like a dick. I just hate when people say wet shouldn't kill animals. Honestly we have been doing it for millions of years why stop now?
Tradition Fallacy	Hundreds of millions of years of work have preceded us, by our ancestors, but sure humanity doesn't actually need work.  Let's just do away with work.  What could go wrong?  /s  Seriously, though humans must have work or decay sets in very quickly.  Sure, we all may think that we would go to museums more, expand upon our education, and spend more time with family IF WE JUST had a few more hours a week, but in reality this time would be spent in front of the t.v. or worse.  tldr: humans have evolved around work and require work to remain mentally healthy.
Tradition Fallacy	I'm a journalist and actually working on a a piece like this. In many cases the midwife mid labor will recommend going to hospital setting if there's a problem. People that plan of having a natural birth should have a plan b just in case. But yeah humans and animals have been having babies like this for a pretty long time. 
Tradition Fallacy	"Crunches aren't bad. Your great great grandfather did crunches. People have been doing crunches for generations without issue. Every exercise has something ""bad"" about it. Not walking anywhere and spending all day in the supine position is better on your knee than going for a jog. Some of this shit is ridiculous.   ""10 reasons why moving is bad for you."" "
Tradition Fallacy	"Of all the longest living societies, not a single one has ever been 100% vegan.  Btw, I'm vegan for 10 years  Edit:  There's a huge difference in ""mostly"" vegan ala ""plant-based"" and 100% vegan.  To date, there is no society so far discovered that has ever been 100% vegan for any significant time.  That doesn't mean being vegan is unhealthy. I'm just pointing out the argument.  "
Tradition Fallacy	"What is secretive about the agreement -- hasn't the full text of the agreement been publicly available for months now?  You also refer to ""*negotiated in secret*"" -- can you cite examples of major multilateral treaties (trade or otherwise) that were negotiated in a different manner?   "
Tradition Fallacy	Avocado doesn't belong anywhere near a hotdog. A full hotdog should be ketchup, mustard, raw onions, fried onions and pickle slices.
Tradition Fallacy	Do we really need to have all these posts every beta?  Beta is paid, it has always been paid, it will always be paid.  Let's all move on...
Tradition Fallacy	This dates back so far in human history, how can you feel people are only pretending? 
Tradition Fallacy	People have been murdering and conquering eachother since before recorded history. Its all just settled down with white people on top of the burning pile of corpses that every race is responsible for.  Your noble savage sentiment is just as racist as anything else.
Tradition Fallacy	Wrong. Your decisions made a child. You did that. Not Obama. Less than .005% of pregnancies in America are the result of a Rape. Promiscuos whores used to be treated very harshly, and we are the precipice of a societal collapse. If you believe for a moment all the liberalism will continue in a distopia, you are insane.
Tradition Fallacy	Not all activity qualifies as a marriage.  Certain activities simply don't meet the definition.  You can't hop on one foot, stick a feather in your cap, and dance like no one is looking and call that activity a marriage.  It is not what the law recognizes as marriage.  Right now, the legal definition of marriage is a single man and a single women.  Some people think the definition should expand to include any consenting adults, no matter what gender or how many, can enter a legal status of marriage.  The argument that it shouldn't include that is more based on the fact that it currently doesn't and there's been little call to change it so far and modern efforts have failed to meet popular vote.  
Tradition Fallacy	**[KevinMcCallister](http://para.ms/reus/KevinMcCallister)**: [^^original ^^reddit ^^link](http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1wtsui/a/cf5j1w5/?1wttpe)  Has anyone here actually watched the Super Bowl before? It is always larger than life. It always is very patriotic, this year perhaps more than normal as it's the first in New York in decades. The commercials are always over the top, and often cryptic to take advantage of the huge audience and social media activity. And the productions and announcers always pull out all the stops...which can lead to awkward moments and comments.  The Super Bowl is bizarre for a variety of reasons (like all entertainment), but some sort of blood ritual or false flag conditioning it is not. Also, no one is uncovering anything surprising here with the patriotism angle -- this has been standard practice in American sports for years.  Enjoy the game, folks.
Tradition Fallacy	"How about the ""it's my constitutional right"" argument?"
Tradition Fallacy	Murdering animals and eating their flesh has brought people together since your ancestors were living in caves you dunce.
Tradition Fallacy	its engraved by ur cultural standards. your growing up so they expect you to dress like a woman of ur ethnic background, just like all the other girls and woman from their country of origin
Naturalistic Fallacy	All cultures eventually conflict with eachother. Stronger cultures just tend to be the ones that survive that confrontation.   Whose to blame people for simply obeying the natural order of things?
Naturalistic Fallacy	You seen this is a lot of other animals like dogs, gorillas, cats. They HATE young animals because they dont know the rules of socialization and a unpredictable. Ie the big dog that looks afraid of a puppy: hes not afraid just unsure of what it will do because it wont play bow or use intention movements
Naturalistic Fallacy	Yeah... If science could stop messing with our food that would be great.
Naturalistic Fallacy	People are selfish by nature. You cant except a couple to adopt a child when they have the means to create their own
Naturalistic Fallacy	Normalising violence against animals? Guys, violence amongst animals IS normal.  Everything eats everything.  Even some plants eat animals. That's just reality.
Naturalistic Fallacy	&gt;  They KNOW this is where their food comes from  Yep, your right I do.  &gt; but they wont watch them  I've watched several of the ones vegans always talk about. I don't particularly care.  &gt; theyre pussies who cant face the evil that is committed for their stomachs  I've killed my own animals before, doesn't bother me. It's not particularly evil, it's the natural order of things.
Naturalistic Fallacy	You're just not okay with humans being nature. And not everyone would agree that taking supplements every day is a better alternative.   People have a right to eat meat and acquire macronutrients the way they evolved to.
Naturalistic Fallacy	&gt;Why has a perfect and almighty being (Allah) created such a vile and chaotic world?  A false equivalence and a subjective opinion. My question for you is why does a perfect and almighty being has to be judged by your subjective unsubstantiated opinion?   &gt;Why is nature (especially in animals) so much about the survival of the fittest, animals have to kill other animals to survive in this world.   The food chain is how life is. Why do you think this is wrong?   &gt;Shouldn't an almighty being create a perfect and peaceful world, for example, why shouldn't all animals source their needs from the Sun (like plants)?  Another false equivalence and a subjective opinion. My question for you is why does a perfect and almighty being has to be judged by your subjective unsubstantiated opinion?
Naturalistic Fallacy	Humans are Omnivores, get over it.
Naturalistic Fallacy	The Earth provides animals. And let us never forget, **WE** are animals. Omnivores, specifically. A lion *could* just eat grass if it really wanted to, but that would be one sad ass lion.  Be what you are, and don't feel bad about it.
Naturalistic Fallacy	We are omnivorous by design. I lean more toward nature intending for us to have a mixed diet over choosing a carnivorous or vegetarian diet exclusively.  Humans do engage in factory farming though, which is unnatural. That's the key difference to my mind with humans vs animals.
Naturalistic Fallacy	I don't think so. I think it's got a place in society. We don't have to become germophobs because of this. Touching and interacting with humans is, well, human.
Naturalistic Fallacy	"Here's one: If a woman fucks tons of guys she's a dirty whore. If a man does, he's a badass.  Here's why it makes sense: Biologically, mans goal is to spread his seed far and wide, while womens is to be choosy of her partner. It is n't easy for a male to have sex, it's easy as sin for women to have sex. The ""double standard"" is completely fair and logical."
Naturalistic Fallacy	"The fact that we need ""study after study"" to even begin to argue that men and women are naturally different is just the stupidest thing I can possibly imagine. Go take a look at nature and tell me whether or not the vast majority of mammals don't differ radically in behaviour and social role along gender lines.  #(hashtag)endlionpatriarchy"
Naturalistic Fallacy	Heres a fun fact for everyone: Nature is harsh and disgusting. There may be pets you think are cute and beautiful, but it is a disgusting things stuck in a chain of horrible events. Your think that baby cow is adorable? Well its not so cute when you see its slimy guts being chomped at by a wolf.  The fact that humans drink milk from a different species is just another thing in the long list of oddities in the human species, not to mention all of the other weird things other species do.
Naturalistic Fallacy	Because blasting someone in their shitter is completely contrary to how God designed nature and our bodies. You dont even have to be religious to know this. Men and womens parts are designed to go with the other. Theres a reason homosexuality is considered taboo even in the farthest most remote peoples on the planet.
Naturalistic Fallacy	There's a reason why polygamy has been the norm for most societies (outside of the Abrahamic religions) but not the other way around.   Men and women have different natures in this regard, and these differences are meant to be complementary. The biological and sexual impulses hardwired into the male and female brains have stayed the same for tens of thousands of years, and that's essentially how we advanced as a species.
Naturalistic Fallacy	We should have meat as part of our diet, and at least part of our food should be cooked.  (evolution of jaw and teeth)
Naturalistic Fallacy	Eating meat isn't the problem, it is a natural part of the food chain going back hundreds of millions of years. Factory farming is the problem
Naturalistic Fallacy	Everything youve said is purely subjective.   Define what makes an animal pure.  We have canine teeth designed to eat meat and how is us eating meat any different then a lion, simple because we breed them for it?
Naturalistic Fallacy	Humans are animals too, that's the explanation.
Naturalistic Fallacy	I mean, I think the conscious argument is moot either way; does it really matter if capitalism is an emergent property? Are emergent systems inherently good? If not, a consciously guided system would help to erase many of the things capitalists also claim to defend exploitation; its human nature, or its the end of all ideology.   A consciously guided socialism would end greed, which lets suppose is core to humanity, from causing harm. We do the same for other supposedly core feelings like wrath that evolves to murder or envy that evolves to theft (of personal property/decorative commodities).  In the end, all coherence leads to fascism or communism.
Naturalistic Fallacy	agreed, it is so fucking dehumanizing to women and unnatural to support surrogacy, as well as narcissistic considering that you would pay someone else so much to rent their womb when you can just adopt a baby
Naturalistic Fallacy	Well, food chain is a legit argument. Humans are predators by every measure
Naturalistic Fallacy	"Perhaps I'm late to realize this, but you know how gay activists claim gay ""relationships"" occur in nonhuman animal species, making homosexuality in humans natural?   Well there's truly no parallel for transexuality in the animal kingdom."
Naturalistic Fallacy	&gt; how do we morally justify killing an animal if it's unnecessary, as in if we don't have to ?  Why would we need to justify it in the first place? There is no higher authority than us.
Naturalistic Fallacy	Because these laws, rights really, detail what freedoms you have naturally, and must be preserved to build a proper society around.
Naturalistic Fallacy	What if I dont think people should self medicate with man-made compounds but I also dont think plants should be outlawed?
Naturalistic Fallacy	Most of the species that ever lived are extinct. Where is the balance between ethical conservation and interfering with the natural course of things.
Naturalistic Fallacy	If it werent for cooked meat, we'd still be monkeys. And thats a fact.
Naturalistic Fallacy	But we're omnivores ourselves? It's in our nature to eat meat.
Naturalistic Fallacy	Fuck vasectomy. Its fucking unnatural. Just use condoms if you really want to smash. Or dont smash at all.
Naturalistic Fallacy	It doesn't need to be justified, it's natural.
Naturalistic Fallacy	I eat meat. I see nothing wrong with eating meat. Killing animals for food is the way nature works. Its natural.   But killing animals for no purpose is not natural. Live shredding male chicks just because they serve no purpose to us is incredibly cruel. Killing them for no purpose is bad enough,  but live shredding them is ridiculous. These are living breathing creatures.
Naturalistic Fallacy	While it may appear to be safe in the short term, we still have no way of knowing the long term effects of genetic engineering and thus there is an inherent risk that doesnt exist in normal food. For me, Im not willing to take that risk. There is also the fact that GE crosses species barriers, something that doesnt exist in nature, and does not happen with traditional plant breeding.
Naturalistic Fallacy	Earth provides animals dude. Honestly the most psychedelic and sustainable way to have a well rounded diet is by hunting.   That said I became vegan for 2yrs after a shrooms trip. It was a good learning experience but at the same time, in spite of knowing how to eat and compensating for calories with big portions and frequent meals I still lost 20lbs and got sick really easily. When I switched back to meat my complexion got darker,my body filled out again, and I stopped coughing all the time.   Animals eat other animals. We are animals. Our bodies are adapted to eating animals and we have eaten animals for all of time. There is nothing inherently wrong with it. There are supply chain issues tho no doubt.
Naturalistic Fallacy	For me personally, this (the period squeamishness) would be enough of a reason to break up. Nobody owes anyone anything when it comes to sex, but why would you go through the effort of getting him off when you are treated as an untouchable while on your period?  And also; women bleed. It is completely natural, and we often have higher sex drives in the days before, or during. A man that gets weird about it to me is not a man, but an uneducated boy that instead of informing himself, and normalizing the taboo that shouldnt be a taboo to begin with, hides behind a patriarchal idea of who women are and how everything about them needs to be a certain way to be desirable or acceptable. Ugh.
Naturalistic Fallacy	Animal nature is unethical apparently. Fuckin sheep is what vegans are.
Naturalistic Fallacy	According to history, wolves only ate nuts and berries when there was no food left for them to eat. They ARE MEANT to hunt and kill animals. That's why their teeth are so sharp. They're meant to kill things. You half eaten egg.
Naturalistic Fallacy	You do realize transgender people have existed in one form or another all across the world for thousands of years, right?
Naturalistic Fallacy	Animals reproduce. It is a natural behaviour.
Naturalistic Fallacy	Nature let's us kill, torture, etc. Nature doesn't say shit. Why should we minimize the mistreatment of the animals, where's nature there? When appeal to nature meets damaged synapses.
Naturalistic Fallacy	Tell that to our entire evolutionary history lol
Naturalistic Fallacy	Animals eat animals.  Humans are an animal species, omnivorous as well.  Being vegan is going against nature.  Just like being in a disco until 7 in the morning, we are not nocturnal animals.  Those kinds of behaviors are erratic and irrational.  They demonstrate how the human being is the only species in the world that does not fit in nature.
Naturalistic Fallacy	Having children is literally the number one biological imperative for animals. Reproduction is the entire point of every life form that has ever existed.  You can try to get all big brained and think your way out of it, but shaming people for following their most important instinct is pretty evil.
Naturalistic Fallacy	Raw food is fine. My two goldens have been eating it since 8 weeks. They are dogs, they arent meant to eat biscuits. Its not Natural. Dont let people scare you about raw food. This is one of the biggest myths people try and push. Dogs are happier, healthier and less trips to the vet when the eat a raw diet. Nothing wrong with a little kibble here and there, but I would not recommend all the time.
Naturalistic Fallacy	It should make you feel uncomfortable that you deny feeling natural human emotions....
Naturalistic Fallacy	The video is true for women, biologically women are not designed to go around and fuck everyone. Women should secure the best possible mate for offspring and protect themselves from getting pregnant too easily  As a man though, biologically we want to spread our seed so that our genes survive into the next generations. Men need variety. To support this, It's been proven that men's testosterone levels lower if theyre in a monogamous relationship. The testosterone rises again when fucking somebody new.  In conclusion: keep being a coomer lads
Naturalistic Fallacy	Killing needlessly: psychopathic Killing for food: natural Omnivore deciding not to eat meat: fine
Naturalistic Fallacy	Suffering is part of nature and its not our business to minimize it. Head on over to /r/natureismetal.   Humans havent been particularly great news for other species, but believe me, suffering is ubiquitous in the animal kingdom. Suffering is often necessary and unavoidable. Cant really reduce the suffering of a zebra tripping over its own intestines as it tries unsuccessfully to flee from lions, for example.
Naturalistic Fallacy	Sure, but we've still evolved to eat meat. You can choose to eat it or choose not to, but there's nothing wrong with someone for wanting it. All we can do is do our best to responsibly consume whatever it is we choose to eat, but nobody is unethical for choosing to eat something our bodies desire. What our minds desire is up to us.
Naturalistic Fallacy	I dont have to justify it, vegans assume most people consider an animal life to be on par with human life, its not.  If I was in the position to save my pet or a stranger Id never met before of course I would save the human. I dont want animals to suffer and I earn enough that I can afford to buy free range meat from reliable sources, I dont feel bad that an animal was killed so I can eat it, I dont believe its wrong in anyway so long as while its alive it isnt mistreated.   There is nothing morally wrong about killing animals for food, you realise animals kill other animals for food too right?
Naturalistic Fallacy	OP, the living unborn human baby is in its natural, nature intended location doing what it naturally is supposed to do until birth.  Does that unborn living human baby who is in the natural and intended habitat deserve to be killed just because it may take up to 9 months to be born?
Naturalistic Fallacy	I'm not a doctor in any field but the idea that any body part has zero function after millions of years of evolution seems unlikely to me.
Naturalistic Fallacy	No minor, no person unable to give informed consent, should be subjected to therapies, drugs or surgeries to destructively interfere with their natural sexual/gender development.
Naturalistic Fallacy	Meat is what made hominids into human beings.
Naturalistic Fallacy	how hard is for trannies to accept their natural gender?
Naturalistic Fallacy	I agree with this, but one conflicted thought that always comes out is how animals eat each other. Circle of life. The only thing that bothers me about humans eating meat is how we do it. How we harvest it. How we inject these animals with bullshit for more meat and keep them captive for the duration of lives. It'd be much better to hunt your own food i think
Naturalistic Fallacy	Because lions kill other animals and eat them. I dont see you campaigning against them for eating other living animals.
Naturalistic Fallacy	For humans, human lives are more important. The experiments done on these animals are necessary for medical breakthroughs that would save a lot of lives.  Your arguments rests on the assumption that humans and animals hold the same value. I disagree simply because prioritizing one's own species over others is a very natural thing to do. Would you say a lion killing hyena cubs to prevent future competition to be immoral? Or obligate parasites living off their hosts to be ethically wrong?
Naturalistic Fallacy	Like where I think though is that a lot of animals eat other animals too and I dont think thats wrong. So I sometimes think maybe if theyre raised humanely or something its ok to eat them. I dont know honestly Im still figuring things out
Naturalistic Fallacy	The folks over in the carnivore and zero carb tend to the same opinions over fasting. Not sure why people think humans were some alpha predator as we evolved. We we're a pursuit predator and scavengers, so fasting several days followed by gorging would have been common place for us
Naturalistic Fallacy	Just continue to eat meat. Jesus fucking Christ. You do realize, humans were made to be omnivores, right? You dont get a gold fuckin medal for being vegan you know... If anything youre gonna end up having to take more vitamins to compensate for the lack of nutrients.
Naturalistic Fallacy	Animals eat animals. Its natural no?
Naturalistic Fallacy	Nature is brutal...take any predator and look how theu kill prey. Dogs are just doing the same here.  Orchestrated yes but just nature being nature
Naturalistic Fallacy	I will never give up meat, not even for the last gay guy on earth.  Don't let your partner bully you into cutting things you enjoy out of your life. It's your choice to eat meat. He needs to learn to accept it. Plus, animals eat other animals. That's a fact. But if your partner thinks you're a monster for eating meat, ask him where his smartphone was made.
Naturalistic Fallacy	homosexuality is biologically flawed, shouldnt exist
Naturalistic Fallacy	"Incoming comments of things that are nutritious but people don't consider healthy because they're high in calories AND other random shit they read on a blog who's ultimate goal is to convince them to spend money on something at some point. Olive oil is healthy even though it has calories and fruit is healthy even though it has carbs. Dairy and red meat are fine - people have been consuming them for centuries and they did shit like building pyramids using just their hands. You don't need to live off of bland chicken breasts, broccoli, and scrambled eggs to be healthy.  Also people need to learn the difference between added sugar and natural sugar. The sugar in fruit is not the same sugar in candy bars.  I think one of the biggest reasons for the obesity epidemic in America is the over-complication of nutrition. A new food is ""unhealthy"" every week."
Naturalistic Fallacy	"Planted forests, however, are not the same as [Old-growth forests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old-growth_forest). Planting rows of trees does not replace old-growth, but sadly a lot of statistics and political ""action"" only does just that."
Naturalistic Fallacy	Eating animals is natural. Its happened for billions of years, and Vegans cant change it.
Naturalistic Fallacy	Disagree, therefore upvote. BUT:  Lemme say- why is everyone on their high horse about caffeine? This seems like some complaint from a home-schooled kid whose parents taught them everything is evil.   Caffeine occurs in nature. Coffee has been [shown](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/20182054/)  to decrease a risk for Alzheimers at a rate of 65% in late life.   So whats the poison? Sugary soft drinks, coffee additives like dairy and sugar, artificial sweeteners in diet drinks? Sure.   But not caffeine. Black coffee is amazing and I love getting a steady buzz at work. It helps my efficiency. Its an awesome culture to be a part of. I love being addicted lol. 
Naturalistic Fallacy	Im not here to cause a fight, I just thought as a meat eater you would be interested in what I have to say. If not Ill remove this comment.   I understand that animals I eat feel/felt pain but that doesnt stop me wanting to eat meat. In fact when you consider how r/natureismetal its a silly  angle to use. Animals feel pain when they are eaten in nature by wolves and bears too. 
Naturalistic Fallacy	In nature, if you don't hunt you die.  Horseteeth should know this
Naturalistic Fallacy	Sentient beings who also eat other sentient beings.  Hell, even engage in cannibalism. Birds, dogs and other numerous mammals.  It's a part of nature.
Naturalistic Fallacy	- humans ARE animals - many animals kill / hurt other animals for food / fun / no reason at all - humans are no different than the other animals - humans just happen to be the ultimate top level predator   It's kinda funny to see people defending bears.  A bear would rip your face off and eat your guts while you are still alive.
Naturalistic Fallacy	It bothers you more when we enjoy it.   That's the difference.   Animals eat animals. We are animals. We have canine teeth for cutting and tearing of flesh. Take your moral bullshit and get the fuck on. 
Naturalistic Fallacy	Tbh, it's just evolution. Evolution doesn't give a shiiiit.  &#x200B;  We are appaled because we as humans have a weird sense of morale, which is nice, don't get me wrong. But there is no 'deserve' or 'task we have to fulfill to earn our place on this planet' apart from reproduction and survival.
Naturalistic Fallacy	Do any of you self-righteous pricks understand in the slightest capacity how nature works? There are 4.6 BILLION FUCKING YEARS of evolution on this planet across hundreds upon hundreds of millions of species and not a goddamned one of them, with the exception of you idiots, has any problem with killing for food. It's in the DNA of every single creature on this planet, and it's the SOLE FUCKING REASON that either of us exist. Killing for food is 100% acceptable and morally right, and the suffering of the animals involved is fucking irrelevant. Lions don't give a fuck about the screams of a wildebeest as they disembowel it for a dinner. There is nothing, save for your ego, that gives you a reason to act or feel any different.
Naturalistic Fallacy	"I don't quite follow your point I'm afraid.  Wages don't exist in nature but wages are made from money and it is *money* that doesn't exist in nature. If you want to associate ""wages"" with 'reward for competence in your position', then the animal kingdom has many examples of spoils going to the victor/dominant one.  What are the things we are striving to 'make equal' that do not exist in nature?"
Naturalistic Fallacy	Its probably an r/unpopularopinion but I totally agree. Humans are omnivorous - nothing to be ashamed of. I get that humans treat animals like shit at farms a lot of the time, but the humanist response seems like it should be to be HUMANE in the way we treat animals that were going to eat, not deny what we are all together.
Naturalistic Fallacy	Maybe because humans are literally omnivores? By nature, by the way. Got an issue? Sue nature.
Naturalistic Fallacy	"Why does anyone believe masturbation is a sin? It's a natural thing. Chimpanzees and monkeys do it.   Saying its ""wrong"" just makes no sense. It would be like randomly deciding that sneezing is a sin."
Naturalistic Fallacy	Damn man This is 100% natural and I WILL NOT BANISH WOMEN TO A BATHROOM STALL FOR BEING A GOOD MOM!  Take issue with this and it's your fault, just take a damn picture of your food and start eating, you dont have to look at this baby his food concentrate on your cutlery     Thankfully we dont banish women anymore for having periods now grow the fuck up and get over this.
Naturalistic Fallacy	"I think a valid argument can be made that -- as living beings for whom survival and procreation are our biggest biological imperatives, any philosophy that assigns negative values to either of those goals is, by its very nature, the product of some form of psychological defect. The evolutionary goal of survival to pass our genes to the next generation is the greatest possible virtue, by two simple facts:  1) Virtue/value are human constructs.  2) Humans are endowed with the same evolutionary drive with respect to procreation as all other species. This defines the baseline of our psychological health with respect to ""morality.""   As such, any divergent virtue/value system that contradicts those drives is inherently psychologically unhealthy."
Naturalistic Fallacy	Please dont downvote me for this but as far as Im concerned, animals are part of a food chain and are supposed to be eaten for protein etc. I want to quit it though, due to health benefits of living on organic stuff
Naturalistic Fallacy	Not unnatural, it happens in nature. Bi is fr more common through, but cases of gay animals arent in any way unatural, more the exception to the rule in a not low number.
Naturalistic Fallacy	"It's biological, but it's also cultural. Even if someone asks themselves if creating new people is ethical, they'll just brush it of and say *""It's natural! Everyone is doing it!""*"
Naturalistic Fallacy	Lots of species of animals also rape and murder, so...
Naturalistic Fallacy	since eating meat is in our nature, doesn't that make vegans disrespectful to nature?
Naturalistic Fallacy	Doesnt stop animals from eating other animals in the wild.  Its the circle of life
Naturalistic Fallacy	LSD is synthetic profanity; Psilocybin is a sacred gift from the gods.
Naturalistic Fallacy	Actually,there are no point boycotting lgbt. They'll grow more and more. The actual thing to be done is giving enough support to go back as how the human nature is and the social interaction between male and female should be way more balanced as long it didn't crossing the religion limit
Naturalistic Fallacy	Not saying what the teacher did was acceptable.  But from purely biological perspective, there is nothing in nature that supports homosexuality.
Naturalistic Fallacy	Has anyone told these city idiots that animals kill other animals all the time?
Naturalistic Fallacy	humans are the only animals that eat milk of another animal. grotesque if u ask me
Naturalistic Fallacy	How it it different than any other wildfire in the world at any time since the dawn of time?  Bigger, sure... but animals get burned in wildfires... that's part of nature, and nature is part of life.
Naturalistic Fallacy	Animals are food for other animals, why they wouldn't be food for humans?
Naturalistic Fallacy	I agree totally, thats why we need to just eat as natural whole foods as possible, keep it simple and just feed your body naturally.
Naturalistic Fallacy	Ok, so what's your stance on animals killing other animals? If animals aren't meant to be eaten why do so many of them kill other animals for food? And what about killing plants for food? Plants are living things too. Bottom line is it's impossible to eat without killing something.
Naturalistic Fallacy	Women arent built for more than one partner. Men are. Itd be difficult to know whose the father if pregnancy occurred as well. DNA tests are very recent and are not fully accurate anyway if you think that would help.  Its just not practical. This wouldnt be equality it would be cruel since shed have to obey all of them in Islam. Most women in polygamous relationships are ok with it. If they arent they can just stipulate in their nikkah that they dont want their husband having more than one wife. If you are going to ask, why do they even have to ask, its because this is natural. Look at the lion and his lionesses!
Naturalistic Fallacy	The set of traits biology deems attractive, yes there is.
Naturalistic Fallacy	Good looks equal good genes for my offspring. That's how nature operates. It's not shallow and superficial, it's how we are programmed.
Naturalistic Fallacy	Most do. Some use really toxic stuff, spray late into bud formation, and it ends up in your body. Some spray organic stuff that's much safer, and only in the vegetative phase. Most are somewhere inbetween.  Hopefully legalization increases the testing and standards so that consumers know they're not smoke crazy pesticides.  There is lots of research on pesticides and how safe they are to consume, unfortunately not that much research is on actually SMOKING said pesticides.
Naturalistic Fallacy	See, I think that dichotomy is a misconception which is perpetuated by our current ideas of what government is and does. Our rights to live freely and autonomously are inherent, because that's our natural state of existence. However, we are only able to exercise the rights which are not currently being suppressed by other people. As humans, like any other animal, will naturally consume to excess if they are given the opportunity, an unbiased, outside mediator is necessary to ensure that no individual's rights are infringed upon by another individual exercising their own rights. And I think that's the role government needs to have, as a protector of the rights of its people from other people; that's what legal rights should be founded upon.
Naturalistic Fallacy	Not to jump down your throat here but 'balanced' is such a loaded term.  It implies an existing framework of what the extremes of diet are or can be.    For example, if we're speaking 'natural' diet.  Balance can't include any refined sugar at all because we weren't able to process it.  Before the food pyramid came around the upper end of sugar consumption would have been much lower.  So that middle ground 'balance' would be much less as well.
Naturalistic Fallacy	When people follow the natural food chain and our evolution you mean?
Naturalistic Fallacy	I was conceived through IVF, and I'd argue that it's wrong. Sex and pregnancy is supposed to be an entirely natural process. It should never be forced or artificially reconstructed. Parents who cannot conceive naturally should exclusively consider adoption.
Naturalistic Fallacy	Morally responsible??? What a crock of shit. What tells you that eating animals is morally wrong when its a natural occurrence?
Naturalistic Fallacy	Fighting in itself is dirty, why is sucker punching something you can't do?   In nature, if two animals are about to start a fight and one of them turned to look at something, wouldn't they take advantage of them looking away?  Why are you even looking away? You made yourself an easier target. The last thing you should do is look away.
Naturalistic Fallacy	Strict veganism is also not natural. Downvoted? Lol I'm sorry
Naturalistic Fallacy	Let's not forget Genetically Modified foods. They are not on our food chain.
Naturalistic Fallacy	Facts are that there is LBGTQ even in nature, get over it.
Naturalistic Fallacy	Living a cruelty free life is unnatural.
Naturalistic Fallacy	You are evolved to eat and digest meat. From a personal health perspective, it is easier being an omnivore than a vegan, and it is more rational to eat the way your body is adapted to eat.
Naturalistic Fallacy	shrooms have a shorter duration and doesnt feel so long/intense like acid does lol. i used to do acid as my psych of choice but after a while i got tired of it feeling so long winded. and yes they are better or so to speak since theyre natural, and lsd is a chemical. so its understandable
Naturalistic Fallacy	I just looked up the definition. Maybe I'm wrong but using only natural ingredients from the planet sounds better than some synthesized non natural product.   Am I wrong or off in some way?
Naturalistic Fallacy	Murder is killing another human. Its true the modern meat industry is very cruel but killing and eating other animals has always been natural for humans just like any other predator.
Naturalistic Fallacy	If nature does it the woman should be allowed to do it. I see no difference.
Naturalistic Fallacy	I worked in an engineering factory for years and was never supplied a back belt so I now have a bad back and the only way I can get any sleep is to take 4 pain killers before bed or smoke one joint so I'll stick to what's natural rather than use so many painkillers my liver will be useless in a few years so cannabis for the win with me
Naturalistic Fallacy	the very most of those forests are not natural but grown for exploitation and planted with non-local species.  They have a low biodiversity, and low resilience to climate change. The last ten years heat waves are killing significative portions of those forests. That would not happen on such a scale with natural grown and balanced forests.  Also real natural and ancient forest (with local species) would keep its moisture in summer and avoid fires, as well as keeping a very high biodiversity level.  Those are poor and sad forests, and now that i am a bit aware of this, i cant be enthousiastic at all with an only quantitative approch of forests and nature.
Naturalistic Fallacy	One thing I've learnt from reading forums and Facebook groups time and time again is the majority of people who identify as being poly struggle to be mongamous.  There's some interesting books you can read like the ethical slut and also some good YouTube videos that can help you understand Polyamory and come to terms with your partner being poly. It's not really a choice anymore than being gay is imo.
Naturalistic Fallacy	Based, the humans arent made to be monogamous argument is cope. If you cant overcome a single desire your body has youre literally subhuman.
Naturalistic Fallacy	Human are omnivores. End of argument. If she doesnt want to live with meat eating, make a parenting plan in court and she can pay child support for the kid that lives with you fill time that she wont raise since meat is around. Easy.
Naturalistic Fallacy	Yes, actually. Sex is our primary motivation and humans will seek it out any way possible. The best way to seek it is through fulfilling relationships with the opposite (or same) sex. These things teach you so much about yourself and you arent really an adult until these things happen to you.
Naturalistic Fallacy	Yea murdering other animals for meals totally doesnt happen in other species
Naturalistic Fallacy	The Bible disagrees with you, but let's go with this hypothetical. Why would God make other animals commit same sex then? Humans are not the only animals that can relate in different sexual expressions.
Naturalistic Fallacy	It was also a naked tit for thousands of years before hand too... because that's what they're biologically made to do, feed babies.
Naturalistic Fallacy	Tell that to the millions of other animals who eat meat.
Naturalistic Fallacy	If you're naturally attracted to meat and it doesn't make you sick, you're evolutionarily designed to eat it.  There's actually a fair number valid of arguments supporting veganism, so I'm always puzzled whenever they decide to make one up instead...
Naturalistic Fallacy	Seeing as how wealthy inequality has been a staple feature within humanity since the dawn of man, it seems it is the natural state. Equity across all things (impossible) would be an engineered state.
Naturalistic Fallacy	You dont have biological female organs though.
Naturalistic Fallacy	Do you think hyenas worry about the ethics of their meal while they are eating still-living zebra from the ass end first?
Naturalistic Fallacy	While I dont endorse animal cruelty and would fully endorse the slaughter of animals in a humane way, nature has designed me with canine teeth for the purpose of eating animal flesh in the same way it has with dogs or cats. Dump your vegan agenda and care for the people and the animals in a positive way... not just an excuse to push your political agenda on others you zealot!
Naturalistic Fallacy	Thats terrifying. Anytime humans fuck with nature we fuck it up
Naturalistic Fallacy	It's natural, so it's good for you.
Naturalistic Fallacy	So, OP, you seem to be addressing every idea that comes down the line.  Tell me, why do humans have the teeth to tear and rip at **MEAT**, and then to masticate it into a bolus that slides into our gut, and is then broken down into a molecular mass that our bodies eagerly consume?  And are programmed to encounter and use properly?  Personally, I believe that God made us the way we are, but just in case you don't believe in God, check it out.  You rip and tear meat and the you masticate it.  Darwin was no vegetarian. nor was that guy who used to run the Sand Diego Zoo.  Shut up.
Naturalistic Fallacy	There is some leeway for a healthy younger person.   But it's pretty damn clear that getting much beyond 15% calories from fat in a natural wild environment is pretty difficult, and certainly not possible year round.
Worse Problem Fallacy	Of course an ultra rich corporate overlords would say cows are the biggest problem while we have people starving, wars raging, and a surveillance state that gets stronger every day because of his company. 
Worse Problem Fallacy	I really hope this is like the fad I felt Pokmon was when I was in 3rd grade and the kids around me were running around pretending to be these fictional characters.  Im all for people being who they want to be. Im going to shit if I got to... we all got nipples, but...  The platform given to such a small group when there are much much greater atrocities in the world around us is just bizarre. 
Worse Problem Fallacy	It's still legal in other parts of the world. I've learned it's a lot easier to go through life being appreciative of where America is instead of looking for all the reasons we're behind.
Worse Problem Fallacy	I'll probably be downvoted but I think it's fucking astounding that this issue is gaining traction as opposed to countless other more important topics and problems. I enjoy gaming and agree with these ideas, but holy shit what a waste of government resources.
Worse Problem Fallacy	"I'm in the ""world"".  Very little is changing.  In fact, a quick Google search would show that the hydrocarbon demand forecasts are  trending upward.  How many 100s of coal plants opened in China over the past decade?  But Alberta should shut its four...  I'm not against us doing our best, but there's no sense in slashing our wrists to water the desert.   Edit:  LOL for downvotes.  Kuwait is bringing an additional million barrels of refining capacity online next year, Saudi is also spending  100 BILLION on new refinining and petrochemical plants, also 200 BILLION worth of LNG plants are currently going in to India, Russia, Qatar, Mozambique, and other places, and China is currently constructing enough coal powered electricity to power the entire US (source, BBC) but hey, get that Prius so you ya'll can drive to the Alberta pipeline protests and feel good about your commitment to the environment whilst downvoting someone that waves reality in your face."
Worse Problem Fallacy	"Okay...so?  People seem to use history, and all it's wrongs and errors, as a judgement on modern times. Like...we are to blame?   The world is not perfect. It's better now than it ever was, but there were some very VERY gross things taking place in the history of the world. I mean...in the making of America, we slaughtered native American Indians. Is that...not much worse than this?   And people being forced out of the country is a very very far cry from what took place in Germany during WW2...(and USSR and so on). So, please...spare me your tears for some people that were ""violated"" and had to fight their way back into the country."
Worse Problem Fallacy	You aint living in poverty.  You got first world problems.  Sudanese dirt farmers are living in fuckin poverty.  Youre very much overreacting to that small amount of debt.  But its a good sign youre wary.
Worse Problem Fallacy	Because USA regime isn't supporting and doing war crimes with saudi fucking Arabia right now? RIGHT NOW, not 50 years ago who's perpetrators are long dead?  Because USA cops and justice system aren't 1 million times more brutal and corrupt?  Who knew that a gov who lifts you from poverty and doubles your quality of life every year for 30 years straight would have support? Crazy shit yeah  Cue wumao, Tiananmen, brainwash, mao, and downvotes
Worse Problem Fallacy	100% of amazon warehouse employees are burnt out and make no money. 100% of paramedics are burnt out and most make no money. Teachers, factory workers, immigrants with three jobs, the list goes on. High paid tech workers? Umm... life aint so bad if given just the smallest amount of perspective.
Worse Problem Fallacy	Actually, its not.  Policing gets much much much worse than this.  You are not familiar with most of the world.  Sure Western and northern Europe and parts of eastern asia make the US look barbaric - but it gets a lot worse in much of the world.

Worse Problem Fallacy	There are Americans in this sub that are bitching about how hard their life sucks, while also commending a 9 year old boy for driving his friends to school/work.  And they'll still find a way to tell you how bad their life is by comparison.
Worse Problem Fallacy	Fuck these people. Banning straws and grocery bags here in the U.S. isn't going to do ANYTHING to combat the real issues at hand.
Worse Problem Fallacy	"Also, just because there exists, shall we say, a *worse* form of slavery... that doesn't mean that the situation isn't bad. One can still be sad about having a tumor even if it hasn't metastasized to one's lungs (yet).  In my experience, the ""somebody else has it worse than you, so be grateful"" tactic is emotionally abusive manipulation done to silence people with legitimate complaints when people in power don't want to deal with them fairly."

Worse Problem Fallacy	Once the last physical and mental scarring on the last female circ victim has healed, THEN we can begin to talk about male circ.
Worse Problem Fallacy	Stupid, because #1 this isn't even the biggest issue our country is dealing with. 
Worse Problem Fallacy	It seems odd to me that circumcision rouses so much anger.  Sure, it is a bit absurd -- a bronze-age practice that somehow survives into present times.  But it is so low consequence --  tiny risk and some minor health benefits.  There are so many brutal injustices worth focusing on.  What's so compelling about this?
Worse Problem Fallacy	"Extremely this.  Galaxy of Marvel Heroes Strike Force sends effing PUSH NOTIFICATIONS for goodness' sakes.  Nothing better than randomly getting a notif on your phone and you're like ""Ooo what's that, an email?"" and instead it's ""Give us $20 and we'll give you a random Fantastic Four character.""  This little icon is so tame by comparison."
Worse Problem Fallacy	Define poverty, because to plenty of people living in third world countries, having a TV and shelter and complaining about being poor would probably be an insult.

Worse Problem Fallacy	Reddit Moderator Shitshow Recap: They messaged us on the behalf of the mods on FortniteBR claiming that we're engaging in harassment and all that, we tell them that we are not, and they take u/trufus_for_youfus' ability to moderate this subreddit all the while pretending to be indifferent. I said this before and I'll say it again; the fact that they are threatened by a subreddit with 2.1k subscribers that aren't breaking any of Reddit's rules in the TOS.   &#x200B;  Instead of going after actual hate subs that actively start raids and condone harassment against other subs like r/topmindsofreddit and r/chapotraphouse, they decide to go after this one. Reddit moderators does it again.
Worse Problem Fallacy	Its an optional game mode for a week. Get over it or dont play it, holy shit.
Worse Problem Fallacy	What a rude and condescending tone to take with your customers. There being big issues in the world doesn't mean you can't be annoyed by the small ones.   They wanted the money Epics throwing out, that's fine. But don't get so pissy when people complain about you taking it.
Worse Problem Fallacy	Well, at least your problem isnt as bad as (usually something about starving African children), etc.   Yes, some people do have it worse but so what? People are allowed to feel pain and saying that doesnt solve anybodys problem. While sometimes it makes *me* feel better when I tell myself this, I would never say this to someone else.
Worse Problem Fallacy	"All I hear about is how oppressed American woman are.       This poor woman and all other women who've suffered at the hands of this stone age shit. But lets bitch about ""mansplaining"" and ""manspreading""."
Worse Problem Fallacy	"Ignorance at its best. ""Don't complain about something, as there was a time and place where it was way worse"" is a shitty argument."
Worse Problem Fallacy	Who cares? Meanwhile we are still warring all over the Middle East, presidential candidates are threatening to spend $50 trillion on healthcare and we are voting to continue the Patriot Act.
Worse Problem Fallacy	"I've always struggled with the ""it could be worse"" mindset.   It technically could always be worse for everyone in the world (except for one person that is), but there will always be people struggling with their own battles.   e.g. a single mom working 3 jobs never having time for herself might be struggling greatly at all times, but no one will say to her ""well at least your kid doesn't have a terminal illness and you're not on the street"".     If anyone is reading this they have an active internet connection and likely food+shelter and all that, but it doesn't mean they can't struggle just because they're not living in a cave or on the street somewhere.  So no matter how big or little yours or others' problem is it's as real as you want it to be, sure have perspective but don't think you can't struggle with things too."
Worse Problem Fallacy	Maybe one can still follow the teachings of Jesus, making one a christian, without supporting the child abuse? Maybe one can be a Christian, but not go to church, thus not supporting the church?   Maybe being Christian doesn't make someone supportive of pedophilia?  And maybe if you're so angry towards Christianity, lets have a shout-out to Muslims and the child marriages that are still legal or women not getting equal rights under sharia law.   Let's not single out the wrongdoings of one religion and ignore the rest.
Worse Problem Fallacy	It could always be worse.  or At least you dont have it as bad as ...   So like your only allowed to feel suffering if you have the absolute worse possible situation at any given time? Are you only allowed to be happy if you have the absolute best situation at a given point in time?
Worse Problem Fallacy	What if some people just don't care? Tessa's actions should be put in perspective, WWE is doing paid propaganda for a human rights abusing dictator.   If you are woke then wrestling isn't the sport for you. All promoters and a lot of wrestlers have done really bad things. Tessa is just one of them
Worse Problem Fallacy	You would think by reading Reddit comments on this sub that you people have never played another dynamically updated video game. GGG is the best developer I've ever experienced, and I've been gaming on MMOs for over 20 years.

Worse Problem Fallacy	"> lmao saying ""i hate cishets"" will NEVER be equivalent to the decades gay and trans people have spent being murdered, raped and kicked out of our homes  I don't think the poster on top is even making the argument that it's equivalent, he's just saying you shouldn't do it, because two wrongs don't make a right.  The bottom poster is basically arguing ""it's OK to punch people in the face because there are people out there who stab and shoot people to death,"" which is ridiculous.  You shouldn't do either."
Worse Problem Fallacy	Oh my god I cant be hurt because some people are more hurt than me.
Worse Problem Fallacy	I hate this whole you cant complain because others have it worse shit. These animals think they have it bad? There are some starving without anyone to help in the wild, how about they shut their privileged mouths and think of those worse off!
Worse Problem Fallacy	Unpopular opinion:  People who complain about hassling wildlife while continuing to engage the activities that are fueling the worldwide mass extinction are rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic.  It's silly to complain about hassling wildlife when you willfully engage in a lifestyle that is destroying the oceans, and elect politicians who pander to anti-science ignorance.  The Maldives will no longer exist in this century, and you are worried about someone hassling an octopus?

Worse Problem Fallacy	There's a lot more important problems in the game than this.
Worse Problem Fallacy	Yup, only the person with the sole worst load times in the game should be allowed to complain. It's like that time I broke my toe and the doctor told me to shut the fuck up and get out because someone else in there broke their arm 
Worse Problem Fallacy	I mean there are acclaimed directors that raped children like definitely Polanski and probably Singer.  But my all means, direct your limited pot of hate towards a guy that directed one single movie that you didn't like very much.
Worse Problem Fallacy	Video games are frivolous amusements.  If you want to fight injustice in the world, I can give you a list of 420 things that are far more important than what you think is worth writing this screed over.
Worse Problem Fallacy	"...prevented some snark? Feeling morally superior as you throw internet insults at someone doesn't get actual victims of hate crimes their body parts or lives back. It just makes you feel good over having done nothing to help anyone and copping a childish attitude.  Anyone who takes a stand over this is just proving they don't have any actual problems or things to be worried about or meaningfully afraid over.  I'm blown away at how secure in your physical safety you guys apparently feel. There are 10x more of them and this whole line of reasoning takes for granted ""if you aren't nice to people they fuck back"", right? What do you think happens next, and who wins if push comes to shove?"

Worse Problem Fallacy	I really don't like this response, this is giving some validity to the claim. Saying don't worry about that because there are bigger problems means it's a smaller problem. The problem is reducing herd immunity so people who can't vaccinate get sick/die.
Worse Problem Fallacy	I work 6 ten hour days very frequently and don't get weekends off. In a way it's pretty insulting to see people angry with a 9-5 40 hour work week. I'd be so grateful to have that extra time to spend with my family and friends.
Worse Problem Fallacy	Still crazy to me that people kill themselves when they live in the lap of luxury.  The ease and comfort we enjoy today compared to life 100 years ago is staggering.
Worse Problem Fallacy	Homeless dont have wheel chairs.  And some need them.  Are homeless shelters are full of people with mental disorders.   We baby the prison population.  Air conditioner.  Tv.  Good caloric intake.  Compared to homeless shelters they dont meet ur needed daily caloric intake.
Worse Problem Fallacy	You understand the bigger picture when you realize the UCP cuts are extremely conservative when compared with the Klein era slashes. It's not that bad. Let's be realistic here though: obviously whichever group gets cut is going to throw a tantrum. That is the nature of modern governments. The stink being raised is simply a lack of satisfaction on which programs/departments to be cut.
Worse Problem Fallacy	My argument is, there are so many better targets in the world.

Worse Problem Fallacy	Fun fact: commercial potato farming causes a lot of harm! A key part of that is degradation of soil and habitats (look up prince Edward island soil degradation if you want to learn more).

Worse Problem Fallacy	I don't doubt most of those people have anxiety. But they should understand if they have social lives and post on the Internet regularly without anonymity, quite often about how they have anxiety, that they don't have anxiety as bad some other people. It's like they don't know that some people have anxiety so bad they can't even leave their house. Quite frankly I do find it a little insulting to those people. And I think they lack self awareness.
Worse Problem Fallacy	If you really want to compare religions, ask yourself this: what's worse parents disowning their daughter over this, or [parents stoning their daughter to death over this?](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/06/13/here-are-the-10-countries-where-homosexuality-may-be-punished-by-death-2/?utm_term=.fb971f33509a&noredirect=on).  to the dude below: no, not at all.  stoning gay people is not the worst case scenario vs disowned by christian parents best case scenario.  please learn what a term means before you use it.  don't forget, according to Pew, 70% of muslims want Sharia law...  stonings aren't that uncommon.
Worse Problem Fallacy	250 m3 of oil now dispersed.  Think of all the shipping that has sunk since the year 1900 from war, fraud or storms.  And then think of all the oil and refined products that has spilled into the ocean from that.  WW2 attacks on convoys of fuel and oil tankers alone dwarf this spill.  Even natural seeps of oil spill more than that amount annually.  This is an eye dropper in equivalency.  Sure it's wrong and Husky should be fined.

There are far greater evils existing in the current game.
Worse Problem Fallacy	Lets see what other system gave us.  Communism gave us the Kim dynasty that destroyed their own country.  Fascism gave us Franco that kept his country decades in the past in every manner.  Monarchism gave us Leopold II of Belgium who committed genocides in Africa  Theocracy gave us Pope John XII who fucked half of rome  So as we can easily gather, every for of government had its share of shitty figureheads. That doesnt prove anything. At least in democracy we have the chance to switch them, you know what they do in other forms of government? Wait. North korea is still waiting on the Kim dynasty to die off, Spain had to wait until Franco dies to start modernizing, the people of Congo had to wait until Leo II died so they can stop getting killed, and the catholic world had to wait until John XII to normalize again.
Worse Problem Fallacy	Um.  I'd say relative poverty.  They are poor compared to other Britons.  Thing is, I've spent a decade living in places that are actually poor, with real poor people, not relatively poor people, and it's not the same.  People moan about a tiny % of the population having to use food banks.  Its bad.  Where I live if people don't have food they die.  They can't go down the road for help.   That's poor.  Children living in bnbs?  I see children begging money for glue on the streets.  That's poor.  And I'm not a millionaire.  My highest paid job in the UK was 15k a year.

Worse Problem Fallacy	Personally yall need to calm your shit. The game has some major faults but it isnt Fallout 76 (so far anyway) and well just have to see how well this new direction works out for anet. We can continue to criticize the game for its faults and make our opinions known about how the company is following the same Path Of Ruin other companies went but theres no need to discourage new people from enjoying the game as that just seems petty.  As someone who has been around since prophecies this is hardly the worst thing ever. Change my mind.
Worse Problem Fallacy	Of all the things Egyptians should be focusing on, this is pretty low on the list.

Worse Problem Fallacy	I thought that he doesn't sleep in the Vatican and doesn't indulge in many of the luxuries that are available to the pope.  And hey, he's an improvement over the last guy. He's way more kind about LGBT issues and said that damaging the environment is a deadly sin. The next pope is not going to be nearly as kind, trust me. Next one's going to be right back to bigotry.
Worse Problem Fallacy	Singer's is essentially a pampered first world perspective, looking at animals raised for food as if they're pets (to be pampered). There's no such luxury in nature, where prey are often eaten alive, etc. Human civilization progressed with a goal of better standard of living for humans, and while I guess it's an argument that we can treat food as if they're pets we can sympathize with, there's a substantial difference in kind worth understanding.
Worse Problem Fallacy	I don't get how American feminists fight for the use of gender neutral language and such (like in my university) when issues like this exist? I want to do everything in my power to help Bangladeshi women not have to deal with this
Worse Problem Fallacy	I don't think you know what being oppressed really mean.   Down vote me all you want, you are just as bad as the people you say oppress you.

Worse Problem Fallacy	In my case it's mostly because legislatures spend a lot of time enacting laws about the use of straws that wasn't spent doing things like making it illegal to put kids in cages. Or reenacting the clean air laws they repealed a few years ago here in Utah. I have a thing about my legislatures' priorities. 
Worse Problem Fallacy	People break rules. People break the law. People kill, steal, rape. That's a part of life.  It's a little video game on a server somewhere in the world. It's not as important as paying your bills, taking care of your kids or being a part of the working class.  This is so minor in comparison to what really matters in life and what matters in the day to day operations of humanity.  So I'll ask you:  Who fucking cares.

Worse Problem Fallacy	"Soldiers served in the military, they were not interned.  Many internees enlisted or were drafted.    Note- people *constantly* try to fit internment into a narrative of injustice and racism.  It wasn't.  Internment of *citizens of a country you are at war with* was and is SOP for everyone.  The US *also* interned German and Italian citizens in the Exclusion Zone.  If it were about racism we would not have.  Enemy aliens are a major security risk.  That's prime territory for spies and saboteurs.    People constantly cry ""but they were American citizens"".  problem was, they were *also* Japanese citizens.  Some were minors with US but not Japanese citizenship.  They were interned in preference to breaking up families.    Also, in no way was the fate of those interned (about 100,000) worse than that of the **10 million** who were drafted.  "
Worse Problem Fallacy	Banning straws is stupid. The amount of plastic that is used is beyond small.  I bet its less than .0001% of the plastic used in the US.
Worse Problem Fallacy	Really? I mean, Facebook, Apple, AT&T, every credit card company and bank, Volkswagen, Chevrolet, Nike, Harley-Davidson, cigarette companies, pharmaceutical companies, our country in general, on and on... but youre upset about shipping estimates/statements? You lack perspective, bro. 
Worse Problem Fallacy	Catastrophic?  Uh no.. Not even close. A child dying? Yes. Ebola outbreak in major city? Yes. Tortured individuals? Yes. Rape? Kidnapping? Hurricanes? Tsunamis? Yes   Two wealthy individuals targeted cause of their relationship to Trump and the sheer hatred for him will put two folks in jail for a bit... do criminals deserve to reap what they sowed? YES!  Catastrophic to the president? Really? The guysve been up to every devious tactic by enemy imaginable. Numerous assassination attempts And still breathes and manages to excel at his job. Squeaky clean alter boy? No  We didnt elect one!  We elected a person who removed previous administrations deceptions of squeaky clean.
Worse Problem Fallacy	Nudity on U.S. television in daytime and primetime hours. God forbid we see a woman's breast, but that guy's brains just blew out, and that's okay. Just one of the many backward ass things America does. 
Worse Problem Fallacy	"I'm aware of that and admit I'm probably looking at this the wrong way. My train of thought is don't we have bigger censorship to worry about? Like them trying to take out the American flag in the movie ""First man?"""

Worse Problem Fallacy	But wont protect kids getting shot in school... great priorities 
Worse Problem Fallacy	What matters more the one journalist that was brutally murdered or all the people being brutally murdered every day. This whole things feels like cherry picking to me. He wasn't an American citizen so why care more about him than any other middle eastern man or woman? So weird....
Worse Problem Fallacy	I suppose if this is the thing that has been troubling you for three years, you have a pretty excellent life or some strange priorities. Here are some things to be thankful for. You have a cock, it works, and someone besides you wants to touch it. Take the win.
Worse Problem Fallacy	Cry me a fucking river, there is worse shit going on in the world other than people eating meat
Worse Problem Fallacy	"Really, the worst? China has people in internment camps and people in the middle east get stoned for not wearing head scarves, but it's social media that's the worst? I think that's a massive exaggeration.  Edit: I feel like I need to clarify that I'm not trying to deny what Pete is going through. I am however annoyed by a reference to a social media being ""the worst"". I'd even argue that saying that undermines the worse problems that he likely has going on here. "
Worse Problem Fallacy	So was the bar burned by a mob and the owner killed? If not, Christians have a ways to go before they are on par with Muslims. 
Worse Problem Fallacy	You know Mexico has a real problem with their journalists being killed for investigating the cartels. Why is this one important? Why would we care what goes on in another country, that has no impact at all on the US/West?  People keep posting these articles like they matter. A foreign journalist, killed in a foreign country, in a foreign consulate, by his own country. There is nothing there for the US to get involved with. Its a non issue, compared to other events that have gone on that the rest of the world ignored as well.   Nothing has happened now, nothing is going to happen. Forget it Jake, its Chinatown.
Worse Problem Fallacy	Maybe you should take a minute to consider there's people out there in the world without food or shelter.
Worse Problem Fallacy	This is so true. PETA has problems, but you cant criticize PETA for some of their more inappropriate acts if you are a current omnivore constantly paying people to abuse, torture, and kill animals. PETA has problems but carnism is much much worse.
Worse Problem Fallacy	Islamists *kill* gay people, it's literally commended in their scriptures.
Worse Problem Fallacy	Not sure where these complaints stem from. So you expect posties to deliver 5-9pm instead then? What about all the people who work evenings? Frankly Royal Mail are excellent and most British people would benefit from living abroad to realise how good we have it compared to most countries postal services.
Worse Problem Fallacy	Clean water in flint? Locking up children? Gunning down unarmed colored people....  cant get half of yall to boycott shit like that, but loot boxes in video games is a problem yall just wont stand for !  Its pretty fuckin sad tbh. I see so much enthusiasm for people trying to boycott this silly shit and hardly any for the real issues.
Worse Problem Fallacy	I don't have any books to recommend but it might help to think about the problems other people face. Everyone faces problems, they just vary between gender, age, location, etc. One of the things that seemed to get to you was problems facing women but there are also problems that men face more than women, for example worldwide 2 thirds of suicides are committed by men and in the US over 90% of workplace deaths were men. These problems don't make yours invalid and this line of reasoning might not help you; I just know it does help me

Worse Problem Fallacy	I get what you're implying but people live in their own bubble. I have had a shit week but in my bubble that shit is ridiculously tiny compared to what this family is going through.  I needed to be reminded to stop bitching and expand my bubble a little.
Worse Problem Fallacy	Its hilarious that people think the Russians have more infleunce than the Chinese, when the Chinese are literally extorting corporate America into silence.  The Chinese massacre Uighur Muslims in Western China, ethnically cleanse their population, force feed them pork, and steal their children to be put in re-education camps. They torture and kill dissidents.  Russia is a comical distraction at this point. China is the real threat, and their recent actions show this to be true.
Worse Problem Fallacy	People have it Worse than you stop bitching omfg. People have smaller dicks than you but thats minor. Theres people that will never experience sex. People without and arm or leg. Homeless people. And you bitch about this shit holy fuck dude
Worse Problem Fallacy	I'm glad the city council has solved every problem that was deeply important to the lives of New Yorkers and now can get to matters such as deciding what is and isn't cruel when it comes to factory farming.
Worse Problem Fallacy	Why are we talking about this, Brexit has cost more than all the Dues paid to the EU.
Worse Problem Fallacy	That's nice. How about getting a little emotional about climate change? Because that's really where Congress has gotten lost.  Hopefully Bernie will become the Democratic nominee. That's the sure way to get rid of Trump.

Worse Problem Fallacy	"It's just weird seeing people using ""japanese manga/porn is full of rape"" as a justification, because I've never seen anyone criticizing the amount of rape in western porn. One time I criticized it and people were like ""It's just a fantasy, no one will ever imitate it""."

Worse Problem Fallacy	I'm going to ask the question I ask in every pokies-related post but still haven't gotten a great answer to: If you believe pokies or gambling in general should be banned, why (I assume) do you think alcohol should not also be banned?
Worse Problem Fallacy	Does christianity say any form of music is evil? Does it say dogs are evil? Does it say you can't interact with people of your oppisite sex unless it's very necessary? I haven't seen any Christian guy who says stuff like this. Or is it because I have met only 2-3 Christian guys? (as I live in a muslim dominated country where christians are less than 1% of the total population)
Worse Problem Fallacy	This will get buried, if it hasn't been mentioned already, that the SNAP program actually generated more money for the economy that what it costs: nearly 2 for every one dollar in benefits.  Also: CORPORATE WELFARE AND TAX EVASION COST US FAR MORE  
Worse Problem Fallacy	>To put the hundred or so refugees reported to have crossed the Channel to the UK since Christmas Day into perspective: in 2015 1,015,078 refugees arrived in Europe, more than 800,000 trafficked by sea from Turkey to Greece. Since then the numbers reaching Europe have plummeted. From the beginning of this year until midSeptember 20,120 arrived in Italy, down from 180,000 in 2016 and 20,760 arrived in Greece.  >The number of clandestine arrivals at UK southern coastal ports in 2017-18 was 1,832, a 23% decrease on the 2,366 of these arrivals the previous year.  >Rather than hand-wringing about the latest refugee attempts to reach safety, Javid et al should be congratulating themselves on how effectively they have reduced migration to Europe.

No Fallacy	Mandatory vaccination is ethically wrong. I was vaccinated, I will get them renewed or whatever (do you have to get vaccines renewed after the pre college round?), but I will never vote for mandatory medical procedures/ force someone to be injected with something they dont want inside them.   As soon as your reasoning for giving up personal freedom is but its for the greater good youve gone past the point of no return.

No Fallacy	She tried to defend her position on reopening with using a story about her communication with University of Iowa doctors/CEO requesting to do elective surgeries...Im sorry but what do elective surgeries have to do with rural restaurants opening at 50% capacity, churches, gyms, etc. The Corner Bar in Belmond, IA has no where near the PPE and social distancing opportunities as the U of I has. She shouldnt be able to say they are generalizable in the least.

No Fallacy	Most women get full custody of kids, so by what you just said most women dont even want to raise their kids but still take full custody?  Why? To stick it to the man?   Smells like some bullshit to me.
No Fallacy	I love the slippery slope argument.   It conveys that you dont have the first clue about how this country works. Do you ACTUALLY believe, that America could turn into this dystopian police state without somebody stepping up and saying something?   You dont think anybody at any point might put a stop to it? There might be a government agency, or maybe hundreds of thousands of people who would probably say something?   I mean this is so basic dude.  Do you not realize how ridiculous, absurd, and inane your thought process is?    The slippery slope argument ignores so much basic common sense that I cant even begin to school you on it if it isnt innately ingrained in your intelligence.   Please see a therapist.
No Fallacy	100% agree. Plus, a lot of the problem that people have isnt what theyre eating, its how much theyre eating - theres no portion control.  Having one slice of pizza for supper isnt unhealthy. But eating an entire pizza most likely is. Eating a handful of mixed nuts is not unhealthy, but eating a pound of them most likely is. Eating a single waffle for breakfast isnt unhealthy, but eating six of them most likely is.
No Fallacy	He's a step towards it

No Fallacy	"For all of those using the ""slipper slope"" argument, that is a FALLACY. We have laws already that make moral distinctions, yet they haven't been turned into something extreme. Just because something is morally complex doesn't mean maintaining it is impossible.   Frankly, most people who are against it argue on an emotional basis. Its not only a moral issue either, it is sociological and frankly political. If someone will never grow mentally, they will never contribute and the parents' situation will never change. How much do we expect the parents to suffer if we say they HAVE to take care of a unresponsive child that has little to no cognitive ability? They will have no freedom for the rest of their lives. If we are arguing on a moral basis, then it is purely subjective and making a room for the decision in the legal sense is more than justified."
No Fallacy	How about protesting at wakes and funerals ?  Both places should be forbidden.  But then where we draw the line of free speech.  It's a slippery slope.
No Fallacy	taking it out of context but ok lol. I meant that healthy young people, who are DEMOGRAPHICALLY ASYMPTOMATIC ON *AVERAGE* are, nationwide, changing their entire lives to protect other people but especially older people and therefore it's a tragic irony that so many of those very older people are traveling, not staying put, not taking COVID seriously, etc. Read in fucking context bro and quit using logical fallacies to strawman people's arguments.
No Fallacy	I mean, shutting down these protests isn't a bad thing.. but doesn't anyone else think it's more than a little disturbing that *Facebook* can inflict control over protests?
No Fallacy	Too young to legally be able to make the choice to drink alcohol or to own a credit card yet theyre old enough to know theyre in the wrong body? Mental illness needs to be treated not indulged, its sad that children are converted willy nilly (pardon the pun) for little more than a show of tolerance and usually also to post on Facebook about how mummy is oh so proud of their transgender hero. Theres a reason they still kill themselves at the same rate post-op, it doesnt work. They need CBT.
No Fallacy	Lol @ government.  The slippery slope in this is just amazing.
No Fallacy	Many of the left-side politics appearing in the U.S. about pro-choice can be seen as a slippery slope to the current epidemic in China. My instagram is drake\_fox if you would like to talk about this more personally and maybe join a loving community.
No Fallacy	On one hand everyone should be getting vaccinated, obviously. On the other hand, government mandated injections scare me as a concept.
No Fallacy	I think whoever would have come after Hoover would have been in FDRs shoes because quite frankly Hoover set the stage for Keynesianism so regardless of who was in power, they would have to have gone as radical as FDR to fix the Depression   They also would have likely had to follow something similar to the New Deal, I only say this because public opinion was leaning towards the federal government having to step in to help the economy   FDR was a pretty snazzy guy, even if he was an infidel, but much of the credit comes from the fact that he was just happening upon an opportune time in America where people were desperate
No Fallacy	"Are the old ""slippery slope"" arguement. Just like how all the people who said the same thing about gay marriage were right because now we can marry 8 year olds......  Minimum pricing works, the data supporting this is overwhelming."
No Fallacy	&gt;And what the authors consider to be cruelty, a researcher would call the price of results.  Sure, but Nazis doctors could have made the same rationalization. The price of results isn't an ethical stance. There was a Star Trek Voyager episode where an alien species that could cloak itself was doing experiments on the Voyager crew for the benefit of millions. Janeway didn't agree with the argument once the aliens were exposed. I don't think any of us would agree with forcefully being experimented on for the benefit of other beings.
No Fallacy	I didn't want to believe the slippery slope was real... turns out it is.
No Fallacy	"It's almost as if we shouldn't listen to what Nazis say works against Nazis     But seriously though why is it so common for people to uncritically accept this bullshit narrative (and similar others like ""leftist are just no fun meanies which is why people turn to the right"")"
No Fallacy	It's the addiction to ever more perversity that a coomer goes through. This is obviously probably pretty well known here but the more you consume the less and less -- like any drug -- you actually feel that pure dopamine rush.   Here's a question though why is it that people addicted to the drug get into more and more perverse stuff to get that high? Why does it never go the other way and men become addicted to sweet forms of romantic porn? Why can't we get that rush unless we're consuming this porn with ever more obscene themes.  As a Catholic I'd say it's our fallen nature but I'd be interested to know your thoughts.
No Fallacy	I didn't realize people could marry dogs.
No Fallacy	Yes, the American Service Members Protection Act, aka the Hague Protection Act.   Straw man, for none of that means that the USA didn't commit war crimes and atrocities.  All it means is that the USA won't extradite people found guilty of such things and try to get them back if they are taken.  And it was the USA that made that a rule for itself.  Criminals protecting criminals, what's new?   Down in the  **Title II: American Servicemembers' Protection Act** section.

No Fallacy	That's a misrepresentation of what is said.   Albeit what he said falls on a faulty line of reasoning and is disagreeable with many of its premises (the tribalistic left, the tribalistic left sees themselves as heroes)   What's its actually being said is an argument against moral policing, groupthink, and an argument from a place on a slippery slope of if x gets banned then why won't y.
No Fallacy	Advertisement for what? Political campaign or something else?
No Fallacy	Yeah, if IV vitamin C, why not essential oils, holy water from Lourdes, hair from St Francis, quartz crystals? The list of crap is endless.  Everybody please downvote this to keep it waaay down on the stack.
No Fallacy	As a Floridian, I can tell you that you would be straight up wasting your time with Rubio and Scott. Rubio is of Cuban descent and is one of the most hardcore capitalists that I'm aware of. Rick Scott on the other hand was involved in one of the biggest Medicare fraud scandals of all time. He probably hopes we all get sick so his wife's clinics can profit of insurance payouts.  Don't waste your breath with these scum bags and just vote against them.
No Fallacy	S-s-slippery slope.   Real question is, why havent we created a system so parliament can convene online? A Skype-type system.
No Fallacy	I'm genuinely trying to figure out what you mean. Aren't slippery slopes supposed to be when something leads to something bad? I guess I might not be sure which culture you are referring to though.
No Fallacy	&gt;Shouldn't we encourage MtF athletes in women's sports?  Making things worse isn't conducive to good.

No Fallacy	Fascism at work here. I understand a lot of Reddit disagrees with this, but a government should never be able to go to a private residence and force people not to congregate - for any reason.

No Fallacy	Wow, the ole slippery slope argument. Stop borrowing from Dennis Prager.
No Fallacy	Has any government anywhere declared something hate speech to oppress an actual vulnerable minority group? Or is this just some slippery slope bullshit?

No Fallacy	Anyone who thinks we're still at the beginning of the slippery slope is fuckin kidding themselves. We're a bare minimum of a decade in to this shit
No Fallacy	This is just not true. It is reasonable to assume that you will end at the bottom if you step on a slippery slope.
No Fallacy	Ok unpopular opinion: the ban was unjust.  She does not deserve to be banned for being a shitty person, banning people who have bad opinions is a VERY slippery slope. Still rascist doe
No Fallacy	Slippery slopes are a joke, just ban the things you want to ban and don't ban the things you don't want to ban
No Fallacy	This is a problem Ive realized exist mostly in the radical left. We like to disagree on fucking everything, I mean its a strength because we all have opinions as individuals but when somebody is disagreeing with us or shall them be not anarchist enough its like there not on our side anymore.
No Fallacy	"I gotta say, PoE is by far the worst offender for lack of quality of life improvements in a ""modern"" ARPG. What makes it worse is that they have even said that they won't include many features simply to artificially inflate gameplay time, not in so many words."
No Fallacy	Remember when Republicans were portrayed as lunatics for saying these maniacs were going to eventually move onto trying to legalize fucking animals? It's like they can't help themselves. They take a look at the opiod-addled paranoid fantasies of the average Republican, insult them for thinking it, and then willingly fling themselves down that same exact slippery slope anyways.
No Fallacy	I'm not hating or anything but what about the possibility that pedophiles ARE infiltrating the LGBT community? Is that just too inconvenient of a theory? They will do anything to try to normalize themselves.
No Fallacy	"&gt;""When a municipal government agency can seize property without a  warrant, and be protected by the lower courts in so doing, it is time  for the U.S. Supreme Court to step in and right this dangerously tilted  ship before it capsizes.""  Sadly, that ship sailed a long time ago when ""Civil Forfeiture"" laws were enacted and upheld (including by the Supreme Court).  Everybody who supports/supported the ""War on Drugs"" is indirectly complicit in the theft of Ms. Rodriguez' guns.  For the record, ""Civil Forfeiture"" was spearheaded by Republicans in the Reagan Administration (Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984), and upheld by the Supreme Court in 1989 (Austin v. United States).  The idea that local government agencies can ""arrest"" property is a *direct* consequence of the ""War on Drugs."""

No Fallacy	&gt;I would have gone with a broken window if he keyed my car but this works.  You'd also go to LA County Jail which is at 250% capacity and has 85% gang affiliation.  I like it when people talk big.  But they start crying the minute they hit Men's Central Jail.  It takes 16 hours to process out of the jail if you get bail.  Oh, and good luck keeping gainful employment when you get convicted or take a plea deal to destruction of property.  You'll be on the freeway ramp selling oranges.

No Fallacy	Most drug users commit property crimes to fund their habit so it's not really victimless.  I actually do believe pot should be legalized and most harder drugs decriminalized as I believe all the war on drugs does is help the cartels.      But they aren't victimless.
No Fallacy	Twenty bucks these are the same people that were against gay marriage because they thought it'd lead to people marrying lamps and dogs. Well, that weird future of theirs didnt pan in reality out so now wearing a dress in first grade will make you trans.
No Fallacy	Neither of them will beat Trump. You need a moderate. Independents will not vote for either of them.  Independents will sit out the race like they did in 2016. Obama had 10 million more voters than CLinton had. You need someone who will bring all of those voters out. Bernie and Warren simply will not do it. I will never vote for Trump, but I also won't vote to be taxed into oblivion.
No Fallacy	Nothing should be considered public indecency. I hate furries as much as the other guy, but passing a law that doesn't let people dress a certain way is pretty damn authoritarian. No victim? No crime.
No Fallacy	Nah, its cool to hate liberals and conservatives because they both seek to have the government use violence to force people to do what they want. Liberals want to cage or kill people who are social conservatives, conservatives want to cage or kill people who are socially liberal. Either way they are both advocating for government violence. InB4 anyone says nobody is suggesting killing anyone, when you pass a law you expect that law to be enforced. Laws are enforced by police who literally have only one play, the use of force. So if you say there should be a law against thing A you are saying you are cool with people who do thing A being caged and even occasionally killed. It is perfectly okay to hate people who wish to use violence as a means of political control. Thats the dictionary definition of terrorism.

No Fallacy	Censorship.  I've been here 10 years. The censorship just keeps getting worse.  This used to be a free place where you could say whatever the fuck you wanted. It isn't anymore.  I understand the rationale for the banning of subs and users but I don't agree with the practice.  I'm vehemently opposed to much of the fucked up ideology that's getting shut down on here but the banning of it all is just going to push it further underground.  I don't know. I miss a free internet. I miss the constant insults you'd see, the toxicity of it all, the FREENESS of it.  I've loved the internet for 23+ years because it's been a place you didn't need to censor yourself like you do in public. FB started eroding that. And now it's crept into places like reddit.  I don't agree with a lot of the things people say but I take damn seriously their right to say it. Censorship is a slippery slope.  I dunno. There weren't mass shooting every other week 10 years ago either. World's changing. I'm getting older.

No Fallacy	Am sters un roman intreg cu explicatii, pe care il scrisesem aici, da' las doar atat:  Cum ar fi ca si criminalii sa vocifereze ca nu e corect sa-ti dea 20 de ani de inchisoare pentru omor cu premeditare, cand ai in medie 60-70 de ani de viata?  Si, da, si eu sper ca peneleu' sa-si ia cel putin la fel de multe mui ca pesedeul. Si sper sa fie niste investigatii serioase in achizitiile facute in perioada asta.
No Fallacy	Weak argument. If we all just disappear that would be the best thing for global warming.
No Fallacy	I think mods are doing the right thing.   If you include the possible harm of S&B vapes then include the certain harm of non isolated airpaths of Arizer EQ and Solo2, include every whip vape that has a silicone tube.   Include any vape that has batteries that can offgas. I would not consider safe a Sticky Brick because you may buy bad butane and it would be harmful for you.  Include any unregulated vape because it may combust and it would be some magnitudes worst than snorting aluminium dust.  Guys dont over react, this is an issue but there are a lot of unsafer units out there and you use it every day.
No Fallacy	/uj a lot of shit people complain about for destiny is stupid but i think this guy has a point. its a slippery slope. look at how it was with call of duty loot crates (thank god bungie isnt doing loot crates but micro transactions are still a similar practice). first they had camos, ok fine only cosmetic. then they added new melee weapons, ok fine still technically cosmetic (except when one of them stabbed faster than the others). then they added loot crate guns, ok fine they added ways to get them in game (weapon bribes) and they werent amazing, just niche things like ballistic knife or crossbow. then finally at the end of bo3 they had way too many loot crate guns and you never had any hope of realistically getting the ones you wanted, with some being EXTREMELY sought after.
No Fallacy	Im against homophobia, but this law steps on free speech rights. Its a dangerous road to go down.
No Fallacy	Heroin is a better example, as it usually is a main cause for a heroin addiction(who wouldve thought). However, the addiction is usually what people would say the last part of the slope is. So the addiction is event 12, and event 1 is like smoking weed once. Since event 1 is technically the cause of event 12, event one, in this argument, is inherently bad. However, a lot of people ignore the 10 other steps between weed and heroin.
No Fallacy	I don't like the title, but the content is quite good.
No Fallacy	"You haven't met my family. Asking some of them ""why"" is more threatening than ""what""."
No Fallacy	Its because people would rather have the rights of others taken away before suffering a mild inconvenience.   It really is that simple. 1984 style cameras on everyone, or wait to text until I get home? Your friends will all tell you they pick option 2, then vote for 1. People deny that they chow down on some McDonalds, and yet theyre selling enough burgers to buy countries.  Edit: hey, angry keyboard warriors. You can stop messaging me that killing someone isnt a mild inconvenience. That comment was about not texting while you drive. Your reading comprehension improves once you stop seeing red.
No Fallacy	Slytherin was afraid of muggleborns the same way Hitler was afraid of Jewish people. A basilisk isn't a defensive weapon; it's one of the more deadly creatures he could have employed for its function. He wanted to keep magic knowledge inside all-wizarding families, which means that he wanted to start with muggleborns and move onto half-bloods and so on until only his perfect pure-blood race was left allowed to learn magic.
No Fallacy	Do we have to wait until there's a gun violence problem before we get rid of guns?
No Fallacy	But is it really a slippery slope if its demonstrably true?
No Fallacy	B-but muh strawman!! :c
No Fallacy	"The drone strikes are done as executive orders, they claim to not need to inform congress (bullshit imo). This is likely the reason the Trump administration put the Iranian military branch under the terrorist label, so they could make a targeted attack as ""war on terror"" exemptions.  Edit: I have been informed it wasn't Trump, it was done before."
No Fallacy	"""Oh my gosh, you're so homophobic with this slippery slope. Do you seriously not see ghe difference between consenting adults and kids or animals?! No one will try to normalize pedophilia or zoophilia you biggot!""  - Liberals, ca 2010"
No Fallacy	Had it been pro Iran/anti American chanting it would still have been up.
No Fallacy	They did that in 2012 shortened season and it ruined Rose's career because with his style of play, his body needed at least a day to recover. Thibs dumbass kept playing him heavy minutes despite injury. Prior to that year, Derrick had missed a total of 6 games.
No Fallacy	"So the new laws go into effect, and a handful of people lose their guns (temporarily?) in the first couple years. Will the hysteria about ""They are going to come and take your guns away!"" die down? Do they really believe that's a possibility, after the Supreme Court has ruled that the second amendment guarantees individual rights to own guns?"
No Fallacy	Why is the RWBY fandom so much more whinny than others? Fans from other shows legitimately don't behave like this. Wow your shitty headcanon didn't come true, how awful of the writers. Like they're all so entitled or something. I don't understand.
No Fallacy	Slippery Slope has been proven to be true.
No Fallacy	But a slippery slope is a fallacious argument.  Just because you have a slippery slope does not mean you need to slide down it.
No Fallacy	"And so exactly how many of those kids directly became ""gay"" because a drag queen read a story book to them?   When people say conservatives, right wingers and republicans don't even remotely understand the scope of their stupidity, this is why lmao"
No Fallacy	It might be overused but it is far from illogical.  A slippery slope describes a real world phenomenon.   To illustrate, Id describe taking heroin as a slippery slope. It is incredibly addictive and makes it difficult to function in other areas of life.   It is not a forgone conclusion that someone who tries it will end up an addict, losing their job, friends and family...but the decision to take it once greatly increases the chances of that occurring. Once you start down that slope you may fall to rock bottom.
No Fallacy	Not literally everything is a slippery slope.
No Fallacy	And the smaller one is the most aesthetically pleasing
No Fallacy	Bernie only wants to ban assault weapons. I.e. ak-47, M-16, AR-15.  Your weapons with legitimacy are safe
No Fallacy	"if the future your going to be like "" I ll taking micro transaction and loot boxes over ( what ever bs they come up with ) any day>"""
No Fallacy	>I do not understand the problem with using an animal as a tool for my enjoyment.  Replace animal with human and that sounds a lot like abuse/rape. Do you see the problem now?
No Fallacy	Really?  Millions of bump-stocks just cried out in anguish.   That's just the tip of the iceberg.
No Fallacy	Why dont they support incest too ? Quite hypocritical  how some advocates just want to support the gay and lesbian communities, but when it comes to incest, they shy away. Although theyre both principally identical, as they use same harm principle to give grounds for their actions.
No Fallacy	metaphysical word salad with aggressive diagramming
No Fallacy	Intellectualism isn't just believing experts in their field. It's seeking to understand their reasoning for yourself and appreciating the information's validity on its own merit.
No Fallacy	[Appeal to authority](https://www.logicallyfallacious.com/tools/lp/Bo/LogicalFallacies/21/Appeal-to-Authority)
No Fallacy	I want to find every college freshman who just learned about logical fallacies in a 100 level philosophy elective and preemptively punch them  Its for their own good
No Fallacy	How do you know Nick could buy everything I own?
No Fallacy	When antivaxxers say their relative is a doctor as if that backs up their claim that vaccines are bad. How narrow minded do they think we are if saying my cousin is a doctor who doesnt believe in vaccinations will change our perspective? How much more dumb do they feel when you ask for a name and picture of that doctor, but they cant produce one? This has happened more than a couple times and Ive come to realize that some girls on a specific dating site tend to be slightly more unstable than girls from other sites.
No Fallacy	This is....pretty biased. As someone who is fully yanggang, even I see that. You just picked the sources which happen to agree with you on issues where plenty of experts argue both sides, and then passed it off as complete authority.   The only thing I am not sure about is whether you put this together understanding the debate and trying to argue the position, or fully believing that there was expert consensus agreeing with all the framing you gave.
No Fallacy	In what fucking world are the left crazier than the right? Its like these people are being purposely stupid
No Fallacy	Chess Legend doesnt mean smart and trustworthy. In fact, washed up chess prodigy goes crazy is kind of an old trope.  Not saying I agree or disagree, but non-chess wisdom attributed to a former chess champion should usually be taken with a grain of salt. (Unless it supports your priors. Then plug away.)
No Fallacy	Does someone besides me post Evan McMullin a lot? Moreover, what do his views on national security have to do with liberal Mormons or exmormons?
No Fallacy	And they say slippery slopes are necessarily logical fallacies. Well, this one was not...
No Fallacy	Four sources who said Warren told her it happened.  Compared to one source who was actually at the dinner, who said it didn't.  Warren deflected from the question. Your friends believed her because they are appealing to authority.
No Fallacy	To be fair, appeals to authority aren't going to convince anyone against their position. Also worth pointing out he isn't a medical doctor, so that's misleading. I'm not anti-vax by the way.
No Fallacy	Ted Cruz queries AOC: &gt;As you are speaking as the oracle of science, tell us, what exactly is a Y chromosome?  To which AOC savagely responds with:  &gt;Sen. Cruz, while I understand you judge peoples intelligence by the lowest income theyve had, I hold awards from MIT Lincoln Lab &amp;others for accomplishments in microbiology.  &gt;Secondly, Im surprised youre asking about chromosomes given that you dont even believe in evolution.
No Fallacy	"Also saying global warming is real because 98% of secentist believe in it is an ""Argument Ad Populum""  Just because most scientist believe it to be true does not make it true. There is evidence that supports climate change, 98% of any group of people is not it."
No Fallacy	Golly, can we get another article about a pack of partisan nobodies exploiting a global pandemic to call for something that is never going to happen?
No Fallacy	That's the problem with listening to authorities. When the authorities are up for sale, your behavior can be purchased.
No Fallacy	Quoting a relevant expert in the field as a headline isn't normal?
No Fallacy	I usually like Chapos, but this is such a bad take.  Obviously we can like something a person says without liking EVERYTHING they say
No Fallacy	&gt;One thing to point out is he never said 2-3% of total people would die from opening schools.  Seems implausible it would have such a small effect. For the last 4 years every cold and flu I've gotten has been from my daughter or son. Schools are little plague farms. Kids are fucking stupid, my daughter once ran straight to her cousin and kissed him on the snotty party of his nose; then passed the worst cold I've had in a decade to me after.   I would doubt the conclusion of that model, especially with a disease that isn't the flu and is extremely infectious and easily transmitted.
No Fallacy	This kind of language is what gives anti-vaxxers, climate change deniers, etc. a platform to begin with. Maybe people do realize that but it creates more clicks/views so they won't change it.
No Fallacy	Lol ask them to support their diagnoses with evidence and they point to their diploma on the wall
No Fallacy	Damn thanks for the heads up i didnt know he was 5 time apex legends champion.
No Fallacy	I havent confused the two. In the olden days when I got my degree in multi-cultural studies the words structural and systemic were used as synonyms. If you are stuck on words I cant help you. I think you are simply wanting to be right about something or actually I have no clue why you are making such comments. Call it what you want. The problem is a structure that upholds racism. I feel like you can call it whatever you wish. It still has a power base. Of course I was talking about systemic racism... it is a waste of time to even discuss this. I get the feeling you know this already. Good day.
No Fallacy	"Yeah, used to be a bartender. How many of these Republican... ""members"" delivered pizza to make money in college? Should we start referring to them as ""just pizza delivery drivers""? I think it's fantastic that someone put the time in to support themselves and their family and still achieved all these other things, AFTER being a bartender, and before being a Representative."
No Fallacy	I've never called him nipples i think i know him a lot better than the rest of you
No Fallacy	**Overall, we rate FrontPage Magazine a Questionable source based on Extreme Right Bias, promotion of conspiracy theories regarding Islam as well as propaganda that only reports negatively on Islam. This source has also failed fact checks by IFCN fact checkers.**
No Fallacy	It's almost like valve do massive amounts of playtesting and know what works better than you do
No Fallacy	The Constitutionalist argument against lockdown.      The crux of the argument is do you value the Constitution over Science.      You still have the right to assembly and to raise funds online. You can't read Miranda rights to a virus.      The Constitution is only a part of law. Constitutional rights are suspended for multiple reasons. Persons under 21 and Felons do not have full Constitutional rights. Neither do territories or. people out of the country. Judges are part of the system that interprets the Constitution for context to situations.
No Fallacy	Im glad Im not the only one who that rubbed the wrong way. Youre talking to civilians what a douche move to have them call you by rank.
No Fallacy	If members of the civilian oversight board are required to go through a citizen academy which covers UoF and pass the same law exam an officer must pass, then Im OK with it. If youre not going to hold members to that standard, then it makes about as much sense as allowing anti-vaxxers on a medical board.  The issue is that the general public does not know case law. They do not know which cases govern use of force or create 4A search exceptions. And because they dont know this, they dont know how they apply to create specific conditions which allow officers to do things like use force to restrain someone or to execute a search without consent or a warrant.  If youre not willing to understand the laws which govern the behaviors which you criticize, then you should not expect your voice to carry any weight.
No Fallacy	Right on time for the paid spam from the Bernie Sanders paid spam account.
No Fallacy	Depends why they didnt believe it and where they were coming from. I convinced a religious person with the Stewardship argument once even though I dont actually believe it myself.
No Fallacy	Who's to say whether that's true? The speaker being the last living member of their tribe does not mean they know that using the land of their ancestors as a toxic waste dump would not be in accordance with the values of their tribe. They are using their label to try to make their opinion more valuable without providing reasoning.
No Fallacy	Naval bases don't have military police? : /
No Fallacy	Yikes.  The fact that you deem personal development, or anyone elses interests for that matter, as unimportant is a red flag, man. Think about why you found it important to even write out and post this comment.
No Fallacy	Why are MRAs and TERFs so obsessed with the word 'biology'? Biology is the study of life, I assure you with all the certainty in the world that biologists are much more concerned with finding new sponges and shit than if you wanna wear a bra or pee standing up - seriously, go do what you want and don't kill bees.
No Fallacy	"Damn, you had the nerve to post something from Howie Carr?  I almost feel embarrassed for you.  &gt;During the Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign, Carr hosted rallies and he had lunch with the candidate on his private jet. Carr had candidate Trump on his radio show more than a dozen times, including election night. In 2017, Carr and his wife Kathy joined as member of the Mar-a-Lago Club, a resort and hotel for dues-paying members.  &gt;On June 29, 2016, Carr, as an opening speaker at a Bangor, Maine, rally for Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, made a Native American ""war whoop"" when referring to Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts."
No Fallacy	"This is especially dangerous with posts that get upvoted on trash like bestof, because people will just upvote anything that ""reads"" as if it was written by someone who knows what he is talking about, when in fact he's just another armchair historian. Taking 3 hours out of your day to formulate a good-looking post with a bunch of links in it doesn't make you a specialist.  That goes for anything on reddit, really. It's scary how often you see posts from people who claim to know what they are talking about, and who formulate their posts like they know what they are talking about, but people who actually know about it can just shake their head at what is, in simple terms, opinionated spam."
No Fallacy	heres my source     me, nigga
No Fallacy	No, because it most definitely factually is a Star Wars movie. You dont have like it, but that doesnt change what franchise it exists in.
No Fallacy	Hard opinions on things, especially a WIDE range of things. Not allowing for being wrong, or deferring to experts.   Dumb people don't know how dumb they are, they don't realize that their opinions aren't based on facts, and likely they don't know the facts.  So they'll yell the loudest, have their mind made up on every subject, and they don't listen to logic or evidence...
No Fallacy	Because ignorance is a choice, albeit an unconscious one, which can be rectified so long as choose to listen.
No Fallacy	Yea wouldn't be suprised. Once you get the Rhinovirus your pretty much going to have respiratory problems for the rest of your life
No Fallacy	can you elaborate :)
No Fallacy	Oh she fits right in. Thousands of preventable American deaths every day and she's picking the most petty and unrelated argument one could imagine.
No Fallacy	In my experience, Doctors aren't any smarter than most people, they just know about their job.  I've watched a doctor struggle to get a prescription to print because the printer wasn't turned on.  For someone in IT, that doctor is a literal moron, but for a doctor, pretty smart.
No Fallacy	"Also ft. ""hello! Have you read health at every size?"" and similar comments.  I like how they always assume the person hasn't read Bacon and that reading Bacon will open our eyes: it couldn't be that we've read and followed Bacon's work and have come to understand that it's sketchy and unscrupulous."
No Fallacy	This is what happens when people make science their god. They believe anything and everything anyone with a masters degree in science tells them.
No Fallacy	The best part is that I read theory is the strongest of the three or four (tops) big arguments they use. I got in an online pissing match with a tankie a while back, and after the two of us danced around having an actual debate with the usual insults (youre a little kid, youre a bootlicker, etc.) the best he could muster when I tried to argue for real was Im basically you with twice as many authors under my belt.   Great for you, everybody should read a good book every now and then. Now critique the actual ideology, fuckhead.
No Fallacy	Im a old many gun owning Veteran and I believe strongly in common sense rules and regulations when it comes to purchasing and/or owning firearms.  Im not inclined to give anything I own up, but no one is asking either!
No Fallacy	"I think a fair amount of us can make the error of thinking that if someone believes bizarre conspiracies such as QAnon, then they must be ""stupid""; which is an easy thing to say. I think the answer may be that regardless of whether someone is highly-educated or otherwise smart, they could simply lack the initial reasoning and/or critical thinking skills that enable them to see why such conspiracies are wrong. This, coupled with a certain political outlook and emotional fixation could end up creating a self-serving pathology that is hard to break out of. This might explain why intelligent, respectable people are also prone to buy into conspiracy theories.  Just my two cents."
No Fallacy	Don't listen to the advice of ignorant strangers online. Consult a lawyer to see what your options are. Just like you shouldn't  get medical advice online you shouldn't get legal advice as well.
No Fallacy	But MMM is not a doctor or scientist and is in no position to educate people on how to react to a pandemic.
No Fallacy	"What is the purpose of this story?  If you have evidence that Trump *does* have the virus, then that would be interesting. But this article just basically says ""I don't believe you"".  This is giving credibility to the same logic flat earthers, antivaxxers, and climate change deniers use. A qualified professional says one thing and somebody with no qualifications says ""nope, don't believe it""."
No Fallacy	Ah, it looks like youre a stereotypical hard Christian. In that case Christianity is a mental illness because I dont like it. Just because you dont like something doesnt mean youre excused from saying that a persons choices are a phase or mental illness
No Fallacy	In turn, million of trumps acolytes,  ignore the facts staring them in the face.
No Fallacy	Depends, if you are stating facts/opinion about a topic in which you have your degree in its justified. Otherwise totally agree.

No Fallacy	It's funny how people on this subreddit don't like anything that's not a joke.  And I can see why.
No Fallacy	I dont think it's insecure to indicate someone else can make a better argument than you can. If anything, it seems more concerning for a person to act like they have all the answers.
No Fallacy	This guy quite frankly is a conspiracy theorist quack who inserts his anti-semetic paranoia and flat earth nonsense into the Quran whilst simultaneously criticizing orthodox Islam for using hadith. Not worth anyones time hes a laugahable excuse for a scholar:

No Fallacy	A scientist with no supporting data cant be called a scientist.
No Fallacy	Well said. Just sit and relax. We can't change it and none of us know any better about the bigger picture. If we did, we wouldn't be commenting on Reddit about it.
No Fallacy	Hey! Dumb liberal here.    Two things:  * I can't seem to access the sources at the end of the linked article? If someone could help me with that I'd appreciate it.    * Would you consider witness accounts more powerful or  indicative than the professional opinion of experts?
No Fallacy	Yes the scientists that wrote this paper totally didn't take that into consideration and their work is therefore invalid.
No Fallacy	"I linked someone IGM polls for free trade, rent control, etc. and they unironically answered saying   ""oPiNioN poLlS aReN'T daTA"""
No Fallacy	Perhaps, but there is some truth to both of those statements. From my understanding, the majority of scientists agree climate change is real...some scientists disagree...at one point everyone thought the world was flat and there were those who believed the opposite....now the roles are reversed, but we still have both arguments. Its really funny and ironic actually. As for autism, well apparently in some cases, autism has been presumably a side effect of the vaccine...Ive heard of people getting other serious side effects as well...then again, they are in the minority.  There is no point im making, its just interesting to me to point these two things out.  Thanks for reading.  TLDR: useless post on my part, avoid reading
No Fallacy	If this gets posted 10000x more times do you think one person might change their opinion?

No Fallacy	In 100 years the whole country will be vegan. Future generations will look back on the way we treated animals the way we look back on black, gay and women's rights and can't believe any good person would accept that treatment as normal.
No Fallacy	"It gets bad rep because of stupidity of people and specifically stupidity of mass media  People turned one single fake and false ""study"" of GMO to full-scale hatred towards it in general public and we'll have to repair and control damages for dozens of years  It's one of the cases where relative average stupidity of population anchors down and stops progress.  What's even worse - it stops technologies that might save thousands of not millions of lives, like golden rice for i.e."

No Fallacy	Arguments that have their basis on a position are invalid argument. (i have a PhD therefore i'm right)   It's actually reaally funny when they do it :p
No Fallacy	Hes a serious and respected philosopher, he works with epistemologists that I know personally, hes young and considered a growing name, he also works in a PhD granting institution and has a number of good publications.   This paper was also selected by Philosophers Annual in 2015 as one of the best ten papers written in philosophy that year (meaning at least some people to whom it is relevant thought it was meaningful). I would say also given my own personal interest in decision theory and that this paper presents an idea very worth discussing seriously (belief first Bayesianism). Its also clearly written.   Title may not be funny to you but I have doubts that it sheds any interesting light on Easwarans larger ability as a writer.

No Fallacy	Appeal to authority  In this case, those that can perform it are the authority  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_authority
No Fallacy	"That sounds like a classical example of that T5 AdCom AMA a while back about attending the right Rich White school that happens to feed into HYP, especially if the average SAT for Princeton was 1460.   No offense at all to OP, but I think this is just another case of ""I got in because of some random factor and I can now give advice"", since, unless OP's *entire school* had great personality,  it seems that there is just a lower bar for OP's High School.   There's definitely more to this than ""I had a good recommendation and personality and just got in"". I think, more than anything else, luck played a role in all of this.  edit: found [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/9f8zl3/ama_top_5_usnews_university_alum_worked_in_alma/e5vwj48/)"
No Fallacy	Your grouping of things in these 'boxes' is arbitrary and silly and has no clear basis in any serious epistemology or metaphysics. I could easily write an 'argument' just as (in)coherent as yours in favor of any conclusion you can imagine. If that's the quality of arguments you're coming up with, you need to take a step back and reevaluate your whole approach.
No Fallacy	Because they want more proof.. graphs and 97% of scientist just saying its true (appeal to authority) is not enough.

No Fallacy	When I was a kid I assumed that all adults and particularly those in positions of power were intelligent, competent, rational, organised, sane and sensible.  Boy was I in for a shock.
No Fallacy	I see debate club is leaking again.
No Fallacy	"What ""scientific theory"" means and how it relates to actual practical uses of science."
No Fallacy	"A PhD only helps your knowledge (a lot) in a very specific field, so while the comment she's replying to is still dumb, ""I have a PhD doesn't really mean much unless they're arguing about that field."
No Fallacy	Wait, Im not sure I get it. Are you saying he doesnt have the right degree? Im pretty sure his background is pretty focused in this area.
No Fallacy	I agree with you, but even the instructions in section 132 aren't great.
No Fallacy	I recognize that this isn't the joke, but I have rarely actually seen an ad hominem, or people correctly identify one.  Ad hominem isn't an insult.  You are wrong and you're a turd. &lt;-- not ad hominem  You're wrong because you're a turd &lt;-- ad hominem   Very telling I think that one made its way so deeply into popular usage, because people hate being insulted but they love to do the insulting.
No Fallacy	27 mins in and now I completely understand why this podcast is 3hr 42mins long.
No Fallacy	"But there are many other situations where regardless of reasoning, some people will just give the excuse ""well, it's just not (xyz company)"" does that really make sense even if other potential companies overtake or are on par with xyz company"
No Fallacy	Yeah, but pleading scripture is clear when you dont have an intimate knowledge of Greek, Hebrew, Aramaic, and the ancient near eastern society and culture is laughably ignorant.
No Fallacy	This wouldnt be nearly as big of a problem if people stopped/drastically reduced the consumption of meat.
No Fallacy	This methodology is dumb tho because the facts are being presented by an authoritarian figure in that theyre academics presenting to the general public which of course is going to go through better for hundreds of reasons than more objectively standard interactions with such data such as in the modern world social media 
No Fallacy	"It's always those who know the LEAST about health and fitness and nutrition that always claim to know the most. Every time.  Told my boss, a former high school baseball and wrestling jock, that starvation mode isn't a thing. Like the ""the less you eat the more you gain"" kinda thing. He says ""Yeah it is, it's about frequency of eating. If you go like 10 hours without eating then eat a big meal, like I always did to make weight, then your body holds on to all of that food and you gain weight!"" I said no, that's likely just water weight and bloat and actual food weight. I asked him ""If starvation mode is true, how do people starve to death?"" He said ""You're right, you're smarter and obviously know more than all my sports nutritionists."" Then kicked me out 3 hours early.   Today sucks. "
No Fallacy	One thing I'll point out...120mg is the fda approved daily dose
No Fallacy	Obama did no such thing.  [Donald Trump, again, falsely says Obama had family separation policy](https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2019/jun/21/donald-trump/donald-trump-again-falsely-says-obama-had-family-s/)  [Fact-checking Trumps claim that he didnt start family separations at border](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/21/us/politics/fact-check-trump-family-separation.html)  [Fact Check: Trump wrongly states Obama administration had child separation policy](https://www.npr.org/2019/04/09/711446917/fact-check-trump-wrongly-states-obama-administration-had-child-separation-policy)
No Fallacy	But does he have a point?  People like to get hung up on his credentials and whether or not he's speaking as an expert on something, while ignoring whether or not what he is saying is worth considering.
No Fallacy	Was this a subject in the US? As a European I have never heard of this 'pause' in global warming.
No Fallacy	OP: >Step 1: Patriarchy  >Step 2: ???  >Step 3: profit  also OP:  > If you disagree with me [insert ad-hominem here] 
No Fallacy	This is an interesting angle.  Pressed further, can we say it is rational to believe something that is actually false if someone you trust tells you it's true?  Your rationale isn't wrong, necessarily, since your trust in that individual might actually be well placed, they could just be wrong about this one thing.    
No Fallacy	Minor historical counterpoint: The modern Protestant custom of excising those books from the publication of Bibles is relatively new. The King James version originally translated and published those books---but placed them in the appendix. IIRC, this was the practice of all Protestants through to the 19th century or so. 
No Fallacy	"Ah, the good old argument from authority ""I am x so I must know what I'm talking about"".   All you did is complain about the same shit that some redditors have already, yeah vertical text isn't the greatest, but champ select is vastly improved over the old one in my opinion, I absolutely hated the old blocky design where you take up most of the screen as if its some 90's rpg or some shit, it looks amaturish as hell.   Maybe some people prefer the old one, dunno why, but I assume a lot of it is just being used to the format and after a split a lot more will be fine with the changes. Its better design imo and even if that isn't enough for you, or you simply disagree with that point, it is also another way for the LEC to set an identity of its own separate from the LCS, so it serves a double purpose."
No Fallacy	misinformed opinion s are wrong opinions by definition, so
No Fallacy	Just goes to show the MSM can literally make up claims without any evidence required to back it up with zero repercussions.    Glad Bernies team is extremely proactive in fighting the misinformation this time around. 
No Fallacy	You should be more interested in addressing arguments and not people
No Fallacy	Its just curious how post about this stay at 20 upvotes. You people dont know what youre talking about. Wouldve loved to see this go big and see people try to come up with excused and justifications but then again this is freefolk were talking about here... God forbid someones disturbs the circlejerk
No Fallacy	I think Ill do that
No Fallacy	You guys want her banned so bad. Appealing to authority by saying his celebrity status makes his opinion more valid. In my eyes, he's just another entertainer trying to cash in on this bandwagon. I wouldn't be surprised if he started streaming a month from now.
No Fallacy	"It's pretty common for people who aren't involved in research to take their information from other sources, like when the Washington Post says, ""According to recent research at blah blah blah..."" It's reasonable to trust reputable sources, while it's kind of unreasonable to expect people (especially 10 year olds) to do super-intensive investigations into studies if they come from credible places, so YTA."
No Fallacy	"No comment on the actual article but i am so damn sick of the ""Im a  blank who believes the opposite of what you think i should as a blank"" formula for headlines."
No Fallacy	Because nearly every single thing ever was busted it didnt belong in the game, but DAE streamers = bad.
No Fallacy	She's attractive but tries to be a know it all sex columnist. She says some pretty silly things and then acts like anyone calling her out is sexist.
No Fallacy	I mean with god morality is just an opinion too, Gods opinion.   What makes his opinion the best one?
No Fallacy	I had a conversation with my mom the other day, and she told me how there are some Catholics in her field that cant explain some of their doctrine while she can. Then I asked her how the transfiguration of Jesus works and why her bible says that Jesus had holes in his hands, while hes always depicted with holes in his wrists on a stake.  I know I have the truth! Yeah, just like a catholic knows they have the truth, and a flat earther knows he has the truth.
No Fallacy	Ummmmmmm, because word of mouth is wrong.
No Fallacy	As a vet you should know that the US military doesnt issue AR-15s.  Just like half step and full stride may look like marching, there is a difference.
No Fallacy	"MotherFUCK that. It's funny how their excuse is ""It's not becuase if the message, it's because it's against the rules"" but also we gonna reduce suspensions to 6 months. Pick one.  They are backpedaling and hopinh this would relieve the pressure. it won't #BoycotBlizz"
No Fallacy	to be fair there is a difference between the ones you take online for free and the actual test which has to be administered by someone but 99% of people who say they've taken it haven't taken the real one
No Fallacy	Climate change, the way its being pushed by r/Aus, is a load of horse shit. Its really appealing to dummies that worship authority.
No Fallacy	It's a lot easier when you're talking to kids about it. Not only is it illegal for them to take the pictures it's also illegal for them to have or receive them. But aside from that, I think the best rule to keep in mind is not to take any naked pictures of yourself you don't want everyone to see and not just today but for the rest of your life. I've actually gone over this with my kid s well as not sharing any personal or identifiable info with people over the internet. I was actually thinking today that I should make an annual habit of going over cyber security stuff with her just like they make us do at work.
No Fallacy	This right here. I think you were both being A for your arguments were both an appeal to authority
No Fallacy	Help me understand, please, the part of the sentence... should be given deference by courts to their interpretation of said law. (I tried Google define deference but it says, humble submission and respect..so I'm not clear on the meaning in this context)
No Fallacy	They invoke your MILs name because they dont have the guts to own what theyre saying, and because it gives what they say authority. If they tell you that more than one person feels the same way, it seems more valid. Everyone thinks  Everyone I know agrees that are also commonly used when its no ones opinion but theirs. It adds a humiliation aspect. It implies that youve been discussed with all and sundry, and everyone thinks youre wrong.
No Fallacy	man i keep getting called names for saying we all need to go back to work. The issue is though no one is bailing us out . We arent paid to jerk off and get fat.
No Fallacy	You don't know enough about the scientific method to criticize its validity. If you understood the process you wouldn't believe in shit like QANON.
No Fallacy	"So, I should believe your cockamamie ""theory"" because a 12 y/o came to it at camp? Oh he has a genius IQ, you say? I stand corrected. "
No Fallacy	Philosophy major. Enough said. 
No Fallacy	Unless you have a uterus you shouldnt have a say on abortions legality.  And here comes the downvotes. But until men can also carry a fetus to viability your opinion doesnt carry equal weight, not even close. Pregnancy and delivery is expensive, traumatizing and can literally kill you. Its pretty convenient that men get to force this onto women without having to take on any of the risks.  Edit: and below you will find all the men triggered because theyve been told they cant make decisions for women.
No Fallacy	>I never get the complaints of WW final act  Then you should watch [this analysis video](https://youtu.be/KWGbEuSfTWw), this guy explains the core problem WW in good detail.  Obviously, you're entitled to your opinion but people can have expectations for the product they pay for.
No Fallacy	Wikipedia isnt the best source of information for chemistry because it often relies on implied knowledge, popular science YouTubers often suffer from the same problem and omit the actual science in favour of a spectacle.   If you want to learn chemistry Id recommend watching some videos dealing with actual degree content - creators such as TMPChem and the like are a good place to start. Ultimately, youre not going to become an exceptional chemist without a degree in it but this is the best place to start
No Fallacy	For a lot of people who are probably scraping by and living paycheck to paycheck, there sure are a lot of people on here who think theyd run a billion dollar company better than who already is
No Fallacy	"It's so weird the way he always uses what other people say to support his stuff.  The Finnish president says US is a great Democracy, so he has to repeat it. It's always ""this guy, who is very smart, said x about y"" as if that's some sort of proof.  It's like slapping a good review on a book cover, don't think I've ever seen a world leader do this so much"
No Fallacy	One thing I absolutely hate about Ben, is that even though what he usually says is logical (even though I usually *don't* agree with him, I can see where he's coming from) when it comes to religion he takes his beloved logic he's preaching about and throws it into the garbage can.  It's just so hypocritical.  I don't really know the rest (only the infamous interview with Peterson)
No Fallacy	> **She told me her pastor thinks** we shouldnt be together since I am not Christian, and she ideally wanted a Christian guy.  There's no greater red flag than a girl who takes relationship advice from a fucking priest in 2019. Hard next.
No Fallacy	>how do you tell the 8.36 million people that they are wrong?  JWs have the most hilariously poor reasoning / logic. It's the sad result of a lifetime of brainwashing and indoctrination. You probably could have mentioned that both Mormons and Seventh Day Adventists have double the membership of JW's and it wouldn't have even fazed him for a second.
No Fallacy	The real lesson here is that we shouldn't take medical advice from celebrities that don't happen to also have a medical degree (like Ken Jeong). Her career shouldn't be ruined just because she's a dumbass when it comes to this particular topic, because people shouldn't be getting their medical information from celebrities and social media.
No Fallacy	I mean, techinally being a professor doesnt make you right. Just makes an argument from authority...  Also, i have no clue whats going on in England. Their politics is confusing.
No Fallacy	The only thing that irks me more than prescriptivism is prescriptivist English majors who think their degree makes them the authority on language
No Fallacy	"His argument just screems ""I'm taking Intro to Logic this semster!"""
No Fallacy	75% of that Wikipedia section you linked to just lists every major health organization that recommends limiting saturated fat intake. Then in the portion that discusses people who disagree, it lists some papers by heavily biased organizations like Dairy Farmers of Canada.  Who in their right mind would find this a compelling case against limiting SFA?
No Fallacy	Yea but he doesn't have the skillset or experience to realize how terrible they are.
No Fallacy	Lol bill nye isnt a scientist
No Fallacy	Haha, Im pretty sure thats 8th grade physics there friend
No Fallacy	I follow the guys he goes after for not being meteorologists. Once he went after them that's who I follow on models. https://www.facebook.com/WxSynopsis/
No Fallacy	Reverse ad hominem doesn't make you right.
No Fallacy	And I find thats the most scary thing about the Bible and other holy books. People can twist those teachings to fit their agenda and can cause much harm in the process (like splitting up families, denying blood, etc etc) all in the name of God. Its just so funny to me because with a lot of cults you see you can just put God in the teachings and eventually convince people what you have is the absolute truth.
No Fallacy	"Nice appeal to authority! From an evolutionary perspective, humans ate meat, but that has little merit on what we should do in a modern context. If it was true that we were ""designed to be omnivores"", how come no other omnivorous/carnivorous animal can develop atherosclerosis, yet humams do? Atherosclerosis is distinctly a disease only herbivores suffer from. For every other omnivorous/carnivorous animal, eating meat is either sufficient or necessary, yet for humans it is neither necessary nor sufficient for survival."
No Fallacy	What worries me is the trend of Dont question me. Im a scientist! Literally the last step in the damn process is to repeat the process. The skepticism is built in. When someone says shit like this it really sets off alarm bells in my head as to the motive of trying to push *whatever* it is without being questioned.
No Fallacy	an appeal to the (wrong) authority. how fun! and you muppets eat that shit up?
No Fallacy	sometimes doctors disagree. then what happens?
No Fallacy	What kind of credentials are you looking for on the topic of public masturabtion?
No Fallacy	You'd be surprised how many evident and obvious truths get ignored unless spoken by someone deemed an authority in the field.
No Fallacy	I dont think this is a very libertarian point of view though... everyone should be able to vote and be able to own assault rifles and have stupid hair cuts and whatever else they want to do.
No Fallacy	Our schools teach kids skills they don't need as mandatory (complex math, science, literature, etc) while making skills they do need optional (basic accounting, home economics, basic shop class, etc), if they even have it to offer at all.  There is no reason students should be graduating high school having to know quadratic equations while somehow not understanding how credit works, how to fix a hole in drywall, or how to make a simple meal.
No Fallacy	Do those bullet points not go at all with that image or am I just reading it wrong as a left wing wacko?
No Fallacy	If your understanding of religion is as sophomoric as a thirteen year-old's then I understand why you're an atheist. Religious scriptures are books of wisdom, not your average one-time reading manuals. Analogically, they're not soda pops but fine wines, not suited to childish tastes and one-dimensional thinking. I prefer religious truths being deeply buried in religious mythical narratives and allegories so only the wisest, humblest and those with the proper attitude and willingness to learn can comprehend them.
No Fallacy	Thats acting U.S. official.
No Fallacy	It's kind of remarkable that on a day in which everyone is talking about rich people buying their undeserving kids' way into elite colleges that these two have decided that the real people to complain about are kids wanting fabric softener. 
No Fallacy	I'd really say our WR group is weak as well. Juju still isn't proven as a WR1, but could be good. Who's the number 2?   James Washington is in his 2nd year, could be good, could be nothing.   Moncrief has bounced around the league and never solidified himself as a helpful piece on any team he was on.   Diontae Johnson is a 3rd round pick from a small school, don't really see him as an impact rookie, could change.   Eli Rodgers for the slot role?   IDK, that group doesn't inspire oodles of confidence.
No Fallacy	Jews: Hes a murderer! He killed millions of our people! He spared no one, not even the children! We were starved, we were gassed, we were killed and heaped on top of each other into mass graves!  Hitler: I am truly hurt and pained by the false and defamatory...
No Fallacy	"Oh yeah, I've had those thoughts too. To every other person you'd say ""everyone's problems important"" but when it comes to yourself, you just ignore it."
No Fallacy	My point is NOT that things could be worse but that not being born is not an escape. Also death is not an escape.
No Fallacy	It's stupid logic. You can trivialise almost anything with this rationale.
No Fallacy	Stop comparing traumas. It's not a fucking competition. Learn to have empathy and take care of each others' mental health.
No Fallacy	Thank you for weighing in and voicing a reasonable response to the folks in this thread.  &#x200B;  Bringing up other injustices put upon other minority groups doesn't make any specific injustice against one less meaningful or real, especially those that hace systematic and institutionalized repercussions. And I think we should be engaging in education and conversation about all of them! One can speak on multiple things at once in multiple nuanced ways. It's the struggle of an evolving society to learn how to do so.
No Fallacy	Fourth grade is tough for fourth graders. College is tough to college students. Managing a company is tough to senior execs. Etc etc.  Someone else facing difficulty doesn't in any way threaten your own personal challenges.
No Fallacy	Fact: There are two problems.   Fact: One of them is worse than the other.  Bizarre conclusion: Therefore you cant complain about lesser-problem. Not. Ever.
No Fallacy	This reminds me...  I love when defenders of capitalism and neoliberalism tell me that both has brought more people out of poverty than anything before. Which, to be clear, they are bragging that they are better than god damn feudalism and mercantilism and want us to adore them for it.  Fuck right off.
No Fallacy	I never understand this mentality. Are people saying I should feel happier knowing there are other people suffering as much as, if not more than I am? Or is nobody allowed to feel any negative emotion about anything as long as somebody on the planet has it worse?
No Fallacy	">Fallacy of relative privation (also known as ""appeal to worse problems"" or ""not as bad as"")  dismissing an argument or complaint due to the existence of more important problems in the world, regardless of whether those problems bear relevance to the initial argument.  Its the same problem tho. One country is just doing it to a much greater extent."
No Fallacy	"""you could've had it worse "" doesn't mean i cant complain"
No Fallacy	Just name it as it is. False Equivalency. If we start giving new names to it the meaning of that new name will be warped and twisted
No Fallacy	Fallacy of relative privation.
No Fallacy	Someone asked where he was while the Amazon was burning. We have far exceeded the land burnt in the Amazon fires
No Fallacy	"When did that happen, incidentally? I stopped paying attention to the ""atheist community"" once I got out of my edgy anti-religion phase, but from what I remember they were generally slightly left leaning or at least in opposition to the religious right."
No Fallacy	Fallacy of relative privation
No Fallacy	OP never said anything about trans people taking away his rights. What are you going on about?
No Fallacy	Unless you or your family are in this position of chronic pain and imminent death it's impossible to comment about the ethics. It's best to refer to families in this position for advice about such personal decisions.  People can talk about what they'd do in certain situations but until you're there you don't really know.
No Fallacy	"The simpler way of saying this is just that ""a worse problem existing doesn't mean that something isn't a problem"", but yeah, you right. People struggle with this concept a lot."
No Fallacy	Fuck! I will never complain about my life ever again. What a headline
No Fallacy	>guys come in from Rockstar Games, and they're like, 'This is not even crunch!  I hate how he word that. Because it was infamous somewhere else doesn't mean it's a good thing to do...
No Fallacy	Fucking first world problems lmao
No Fallacy	People at 52 die of heart attacks too, the covid is killing 30-year olds and teenagers too...
No Fallacy	Conservatives pretending that they give two shits about women in those countries.
No Fallacy	Yeah I appreciate my language was asshole-esq but I dont agree Im on a high horse here at all. I honestly think that not being great for them is an outright lie. It is great for them. There are days where food served is something you dont enjoy and you you and grab something else. I dont think its right to act hard done by - might I add they all took a plate and ate the full mean too
No Fallacy	Whataboutism.  Vaccinating your kids is not merely pragmatic. It can save their lives, and the lives of those who can't be vaccinated through herd immunity.
No Fallacy	Did they really use Climate Change and Human Rights into an Epic Exclusive argument yikes
No Fallacy	As a woman who's a best friend is constantly complaining about her boyfriend, it's incredibly difficult not to agree with her boyfriend at times. I mean like this BASIC VSCO GIRL FROM HELL freaks THE FRICKITY FLUBBER out if her bf doesn't respond within the first 20 minutes of her texting him, and if she sees that he's online and hasn't responded yet? OH HO HO YOU'RE IN FOR A PHLICKITY HICKITY TREAT BUDDY BOY.
No Fallacy	"someone told me to get a second job cause ""you don't do enough in the day to be tired enough to sleep at night"" lol no surely it can't be my regrets keeping me awake and the nightmares waking me up..."
No Fallacy	"Yeah, Mr. Shrek is one of those toxic ""There are kids in africa so shut up"" types. WTF."
No Fallacy	"""Fallacy of Relative Privation"", also known as ""Appeal to Worse Problems"", or more recently ""First World Problems"". According to wikipedia, anyway:  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_fallacies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fallacies)"
No Fallacy	Agriculture is definitely bad for land use and it's not great for water consumption either. The quicker we can grow everything in some other way (in a lab? underground? in high-rise farm buildings?) the better, but until then it uses less water and land to eat the plants directly, rather than feeding them to animals which then take up more land and more water.     I'm also not 100% convinced that having lots of crops is that good for the environment. Sure it will generate oxygen for the time that it is growing, but we then farm acres and acres using a bigass diesel engine or three. Nothing is perfect.
No Fallacy	This is an incredibly common response people provide when someone is struggling.
No Fallacy	MFW it's a re-run of Threads.  *shudder*
No Fallacy	The mood on reddit and Twitter for the last few months  has been  oh youre mad about x while theyre are children in concentration camps. Yeah you can be mad about more than one thing
No Fallacy	Yea, they do. People are trying to reduce plastic waste by using paper straws, when it doesn't really matter, and doesn't make that big of an impact as coke doing stuff like this. The turtle stuff is a side bonus
No Fallacy	Total lies. Mono-Blue games are so much more interactive than playing against control/prison decks in MtG.
No Fallacy	I'll give you an example, I was telling him about how hell is not justifiable in any way. He repeatedly said that sinning against god is the worst sin so it is and he just kept saying it in different ways.
No Fallacy	Greenland isn't an issue. Not the right comparison
No Fallacy	This is technically untrue. Since here are a finite amount of people on the planet, there must be ONE person, who is having the absolute worst day it is possible to have that day, with no one underneath them.    Also, just because someone has it worse does not invalidate ones own suffering, within reason of course
No Fallacy	"It's the ""bUt pEople haVe iT wOrSe in AfRicA!"" trope, but for parents with multiple kids. You absolutely can have a sucky day/days with just one kid and no one can put you down or make you feel even worse because other people have it harder smh"
No Fallacy	"Except for that one time Jesus said it was cool that someone use ointment on him instead of giving it to the poor:   ""And there were some that had indignation within themselves, and said, Why was this waste of the ointment made? For it might have been sold for more than three hundred pence, and have been given to the poor. And they murmured against her. And Jesus said, Let her alone; why trouble ye her? she hath wrought a good work on me. For ye have the poor with you always, and whensoever ye will ye may do them good: but me ye have not always.""  Forgive me :)  I like pointing out instances where Jesus didn't quite act like people always imagine him to."
No Fallacy	"If your consolation starts with ""Well at least..."" you should probably keep it to yourself.   This statement isn't helpful and reminds them of the bad times."
No Fallacy	"The mentality that ""someone else had it worse, so accept whatever you got"" is something sadists and enablers use to keep us ACoNs in the dark and stunted in our healing. I remember getting this flak from members of my community growing up as well as douchebags on internet forums had this effect on me."
No Fallacy	"Or how about ""How come you are depressed? Your life is going fine."" (Many people with depression can stay functional and, say, go to work, some or most of the time.)  Or: ""How come you are depressed? A lot of people in the world have much worse circumstances than you, you know."" Don't know even what to say to that. "
No Fallacy	This is the worst kind of gatekeeping:  The *your pain is invalidated because my pain is worse* gatekeeping
No Fallacy	Just because the worst thing that ever happened to me isnt as bad as the worst thing that happened to you doesnt change the fact that its the worst thing that ever happened to me
No Fallacy	It takes $750k net worth to be in the global 1%. For the global 10% its $71k. To be in the top 50% globally it takes $2,200 in total net worth.  https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cnbc.com/amp/2017/10/27/how-much-money-you-need-to-have-to-be-part-of-the-1-percent-worldwide.html  I'm guessing we don't have many 1%ers here but remembering that survey of /r/lostgeneration users that was done a while ago, I bet there's more 10%ers than you'd expect 
No Fallacy	Basically its saying they arent the biggest problem. Which is true.  But, its a start, and people are receptive and active.   Thats important.
No Fallacy	Other people have it worse than you. Really?
No Fallacy	Other people have it worse than you so you can't complain!
No Fallacy	Not edgy at all. It's not easy discussing your problems with anyone, especially if they're serious. 
No Fallacy	That argument pisses me off so much. There are people who have said way worse.  Yes and murder is worse than robbery but you still cant rob people.
No Fallacy	"""Dont be upset/sad because there might be people in the world that have it worse than you""."
No Fallacy	I hate when they say this stuff because like I know damn well they dont care about women in any part of the world!! You can talk about womens issues in America and theyll go oh what about women in Saudi Arabia?? Checkmate, feminists as if theyve called your bluff like ....... yes, I think women in Saudi Arabia and also everywhere else in the world should have rights and receive equal treatment. If all the guys who tell American women that we should be fighting for the rights of women in the Middle East were actually like activists for the rights of women in the Middle East, they probably couldve gotten a lot done by now lol
No Fallacy	Autoilun ja lihansynnin vhentmisen merkittvyytt on liioiteltu, koska me sopivat niin hyvin muuhun punavihren ideologiaan.
No Fallacy	It doesnt invalidate this request though. Id love to have build-in ways to track your stats.
No Fallacy	Fallacy of relative privation aka children are starving in Africa argument.
No Fallacy	I hate that shitty logic. Ignoring someones problems just because someone else has it worse is moronic. If we were to apply that logic to everything then almost nobody in the world could complain since someone else also has it worse.
No Fallacy	Just because someone has it worse doesnt mean you cant complain about your own problems.  Its ok to be a whiny little bitch sometimes.  
No Fallacy	"What makes me mad is the commentator who says ""why not donate to the homeless or other poor charities"", like yeah obviously those charaties are important, but so are others! It comes off as a pathetic attempt to make someones character look bad. I'd be willing to bet that the same person who said this hasn't donated to a charity ever in his life."
No Fallacy	"It's such a folly to say ""well it's worse in X country so we shouldn't worry about our own situation"". If you life in NA, chances are you can find a country that does worse on almost any issue -- it doesn't mean your country is perfect and could not be improved."
No Fallacy	"Anything along the lines of ""somebody has it worse"", i.e. ""there are starving children in Africa and you're complaining about your job?"".  I realize there are tons of people way less off than myself, it doesn't invalidate my grievances about work stuff or a girlfriend cheating on me or a shitty neighbor.  I'm not flying to Africa to talk to a dying kid to say how hard my life is taking care of my aging grandparents, it doesn't mean that it isn't hard though, we just live in different situations."
No Fallacy	Just because one is worse doesnt mean the other isnt bad lmao. Top tier gatekeep
No Fallacy	"This notion seriously screwed me up: I was severely depressed and suicidal for nearly 15 years but refused to get any help. As long as I could point to anyone else whose life I considered more abjectly miserable, I could just conclude I was a whiny loser who deserved to feel that way.  When I finally broke down and went to therapy, I honestly expected to hear exactly that when I rattled off my list of issues. I was speechless when the therapist responded, ""Wow, you've been through a lot of trauma."" I'd spent so long rationalizing everything away by telling myself ""other people have it *worse* than you, quit fucking complaining,"" that it hadn't occurred to me that maybe things can still be bad enough to cause damage and warrant help even if they're not objectively the worst possible thing in existence."
No Fallacy	"I call this the argument of degrees (aka ""women in the Middle East have it so much worse."")  If you complain about it being 100 degrees in Atlanta today some dumbshit will point out it's 130 in Saudi Arabia.  Thanks fuckface, my ass-sweat is cured."
No Fallacy	Is that suppose to be motivating or depressing?
No Fallacy	That's just scratching the surface.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fallacies
No Fallacy	This is a false equivalency stacked on a really really really really really really poor rationalization. You literally gave the reason the guy is in jail as your justification for why he shouldnt be in jail and followed with, Because other people do bad things, anyone else who does bad things shouldnt be held accountable for the bad things theyve done..
No Fallacy	This is basically just a you can't complain about being hungry there is starving children in Africa argument.   Obviously that's way worse than me just wanting to swing by McDonald's after work, but I mean it still sucks.  Obviously you can't compare the  two but it still sucks.
No Fallacy	https://prnt.sc/m0u8fu you clearly said it here   Now you are back paddling like crazy and pentas Channel.   The train station thing is bullshit to.   And being out in the open in a car AFK seems fail RP.  You would not be AFK IRL buy some kind of store in your car.  That person should have parked somewhere else and Penta is not involved in that situation whatsoever.   But people that are legitimately breaking rules continue to do it with no consequences on whitelist   I will say some of the stuff he did was shity and Im not supporting everything he did.   What I'm trying to point out is people get banned for false rules or imaginary rules but other players can break rules all day everyday and get no punishments    P.s I'm not a penta fanbio
No Fallacy	Oh man, at the place I used to work there were days where I spent 12-14 hours outside in 95-102 degree heat with humidity and no breaks. Not even time to piss or get something to drink. Two grown men I worked with passed out, and 1/4 of my tables didn't tip.   O' restaurants.  'Merica. 
No Fallacy	The money spent throwing him a little party could have fed and sheltered homeless 
No Fallacy	Go play Black Ops 4 then tell me what's broken about Battlefield V. I love both games, but Black Ops 4 game play is simply a mess compared to BFV.
No Fallacy	What? Because you saw a Yang Gang Twitter user? Ok buddy.   Literally 50% of Americans dont vote because they are disenfranchised with their political system. But you are focusing on fringe leftists on fucking Twitter.   You guys actually deserve Trump
No Fallacy	If you go and read the whole article, it really becomes obvious how worthless of a take this is.   The writer complains that he could have tackled income inequality or racism but instead he talks about this.
No Fallacy	"Because the statistic of black people killing other black people is often used to excuse police brutality as ""not racist"" because it's ""no larger than the black people who kill other black people"", completely ignoring external factors like th fact that the two murder rates don't really conflict with each other and the black-on-black murder rate also has roots in deep-seated issues like the systemic oppression of black people that leads to unstable households, financial insecurity, etc. "
No Fallacy	Just because someones fatter doesnt mean you arent.
No Fallacy	I hate that reasoning that because someone has it worse and smiling means that you have no right to complain. Do they realize that different people have different tolerances to different stuff in life? Someone might lose a parent and feel mild grief, while someone losing a parent may feel severe grief for years on end.  It's insensitive to say the least to assume that because one person is in a worse situation and happier means that you have no right to complain. Does that mean that because one person is better off than me and sadder means that I have no right to be happy?
No Fallacy	There's always going to be someone out there in a worse position than you. it's an illogical way of thinking.
No Fallacy	That's some A\-Level debate quality thinking right there.
No Fallacy	"""It could be worse"" yeah no shit"
No Fallacy	Seriously, everyone in this thread is complaining about emotes in a children's card game hurting their feelings. God help us. 
No Fallacy	"http://skepticsannotatedbible.com/int/long.html  http://skepticsannotatedbible.com/quran/int/long.html  Even if Islam wins on points, Christianity isn't absolved because ""we're not the worst."" The lesser of two evils is still evil."
No Fallacy	Dragons and shadow magic fit within the established framework of the world. Eating very little while walking miles and miles and yet not losing weight doesn't.  I get this is just a funny anecdote but this kind of reasoning is really common and it bugs me. Surely there must be a trope name for this type of thing. Anyone know what it is?  Edit: jesus fuck, my inbox
No Fallacy	"""My problems are bigger, so yours dont count and are no problems at all."" God i hate people like that. ""People in africa have it worse than you so just man up and dont be depressed"" fucking stupid mind set "
No Fallacy	I agree that being thankful is a good thing, however the phrase 'be thankful for what you have' is so often used in a toxic manner that I can't take it seriously anymore. 
No Fallacy	"Not sure if this is all that of an unpopular opinion but I agree with you. I've seen a few comments on here from people who were trying to invalidate other peoples feelings because the person commenting ""has it some much worse."" Its a really shitty thing to do and you should call those people out. "
No Fallacy	My dad makes this stupid fucking argument every time. Well the 3rd world is the biggest proponent of pollution! What about China?  Its like Jesus, because China is doing something, were not allowed to change? 
No Fallacy	"Peter Tatchell is an LGBT activist with a CV of near unimpeachable quality.  About the only thing you can throw against him are some of his more speculative essays, but in terms of ""putting his money where his mouth is"", he's been beaten by every gay bashing mob imaginable to the point you could mistake it for a fetish.  Attempting to smear a man like him as another ""MRA"" is ignorant and facile, and demeans your entire movement.  He is probably a stronger ally to women than every feminist you know, combined."
No Fallacy	I see you're trying to make people feel better here, but..  I hate this utter bullshit idea that just because someone has it worse than you, you are somehow supposed to feel better all of a sudden. Often it just leads to people either neglecting their troubles, or on top of that feeling guilty for their very real concerns. Try flipping this on its head just to see how ridiculous it sounds:  'Next time you are happy just remember, some guy just won the lottery somewhere or finally had his crush say yes to a date. Happiness is relative, don't feel so happy for your small victories'  I would tell people the exact opposite. You are worrying about something that is important to you. Good, that means that you care - but don't let that worrying overcome you everything will be fine. 
No Fallacy	It's whataboutism. 
No Fallacy	The quote might be bullshit, but the point they're trying to make seems pretty straightforward.  The whole 'what about the humans' argument is basically saying that people shouldn't care about anything as long as there is something worse to care about.  Which is silly.
No Fallacy	The lesson as a kid was be grateful for what you have. Not that you are helping someone on the other side of the planet.
No Fallacy	"""Just because things can be harder it doesn't eliminate the current difficulties in my life."""
No Fallacy	I am aware of the problems in the world, Im educated and travelled, even knowing this, everyone is still concerened with their own insecurities, clearly the idea of perspective doesnt work that well. 
No Fallacy	Don't use others' problems to denigrate your own! A baby crying over being 2 minutes without its mother may seem like overreaction, but consider - that may be the *worst* feeling the baby has experienced in its short life.  Just because we live without fear of hunger or war doesn't mean our problems aren't very real.
No Fallacy	Ted Bundy is not a Saint because Hitler existed at one point.
No Fallacy	"I think comparison rather deprives you of relief. I know so many people who can't accept that someone is feeling stressed subjectively even though they might not work as many hours / have a family to care for I'm addition to a job /... You get it.   Please, just see people have different perceptions and let them have their moment of complaint without saying something like ""oh, you think you got it bad? Well, I ..."".   Comparison can be great to move forward, strive for more and keeping motivated in general as some pointed out but please stop pity battles"
No Fallacy	People who always try to 1 up your situation. Tell them youve got a cold and theyll respond Ive had pneumonia for 10 years! Or some shit
No Fallacy	"It isn't a great point at all. People can be upset about more than one thing at once. If someone is offended by something and you say ""oh yeah, you're offended by that, but not drone strikes?!"" that's some braindead shit an edgelord high school kid would say.   To be clear, I have no idea what this abortion joke is about, and the audience members that Bill is talking about are likely a bunch of whiners, but there are better arguments to be made than that dopey shit."
No Fallacy	Why care about violence when rape is also an issue? This argument stinks, every problem has to be acknowledged, some are just more problematic than others
No Fallacy	Or, you know, you could find more deserving people to try to throw under the bus. How many calories are in a bowl of cranky-O's, anyway?
No Fallacy	A favorite tactic of misogynists is to shut down feminists in developed countries by (a) pointing out that women in other countries have it worse and (b) denying things like the wage gap even exist everywhere.
No Fallacy	I am so fucking sick of whataboutism.
No Fallacy	/uj I understand that people in developing countries are in desperate need of help, and we should help them, but I hate the idea that you arent allowed to be angry or have problems because of that.  EDIT: but yeah, if the point of the cartoon is that EA is definitely not the worst company in america because companies that own tons of sweatshops and murder their employees exist, then Im on board with that.
No Fallacy	a week ago a new support items were leaked on voyboy's mordekaiser video which shows they are working on some changes on the support items  the spellthief/coin changes are not as bad as supports like to pretend they are. riot arent known on fixing things fast, they will get around on doing it
No Fallacy	Forcing an unwanted baby on someone that can't afford to raise a child leads to thousand of dollars of medicare, public education, and a higher potential to go through the corrections system.  Remember, it costs about [$20,000 a year](http://www.dc.state.fl.us/pub/statsbrief/cost.html) to keep someone in prison. You want to force us to pay that?
No Fallacy	Apathy.  Hence my username.  
No Fallacy	It's so confusing. Like...you're arguing in fucking circles.
No Fallacy	Oh give me a break. Muslim organizations around the country ALL condemned the attack and prayed for the victims. Go check [CAIR](http://www.cair.com/press-center/press-releases/13081-cair-condemns-killing-of-marines-in-tennessee-offers-condolences.html), ISNA, MPAC, ICNA, etc. The Chattanooga Muslim community [CANCELLED Eid](http://i.imgur.com/283eRFG.jpg), the most important holiday of the year. That's nuts; that's like if Dylann Roof had shot a bunch of marines on December 24 and the churches in South Carolina canceled Christmas as a result. (Unfair to the community and the children and in no way related to the criminal)
No Fallacy	"You're making a fundamental misstep in logic that so many people seem to whenever they go off on ""Oh *Reddit* you're so  *something*""  Reddit is not the Borg. It has many different people with many different sets of beliefs and opinions.  People are responding that way, but you have absolutely no damn clue if those are the same people who supported Net Neutrality."
No Fallacy	There was an attempt here at something but I haven't quite got it yet. 
No Fallacy	You don't have to do them in the first two hours.... There's plenty of time to do it later. I honestly can't understand why people are complaining when they can't rush their challenges out in three games. How boring would that be?
No Fallacy	Respond to averages derived from large samples with one personal anecdotal observation they believe negates it entirely.
No Fallacy	"[""Straw man""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_man) would describe the putting words in your mouth bit, taking issue with a point you didn't actually make.

No Fallacy	The first mistake.  Is to generalize people ..
No Fallacy	My purpose in telling you I virtually never drink is to assure you that my disbelief that weekly communion would harm an unborn baby is not based on my personal desire to drink.

No Fallacy	Fun fact: I never saw any trans speaking like that. And they accuse trans of being predators..
No Fallacy	I don't see how Blueface being a fucking douche is proof it's all black men?  From twitter the most people talking about this Doja Cat stuff is women.
No Fallacy	"Really? Because Mitt Romney's solution to the Middle East was to ""go in and kill the bad guys."" He also protested for the Vietnam War and then missioned over in France to avoid serving in it. Sounds very honorable and tactful. His dad was an auto mogul and later a governor, so I'm sure he had many connections that most people wouldn't have, so he's a product of cronyism. When he toured overseas this year, Romney managed to insult and gaff in each country he visited, even Israel whom he supposedly has the world's biggest hard-on for.   And yes, I know Biden took academic deferments to avoid serving. Not hypocritical though because Biden didn't actively protest in favor of the war he never intended to serve in anyway. "
No Fallacy	As a white person, I wasn't that offended. Their points kind of got off track, but the frustration makes sense to me. I think their intentions were good since they end it by emphasizing unity of all people, including white people.   Plus, on a half-serious note, I don't really understand what white people would do in a white themed club. 
No Fallacy	"It Appears Alan is basing his accusation of 'Bob is overcharging.' on too few criteria, thus he's making a hasty generalization. As Bob said '""My costs include purchasing the truck, maintaining it, gas, insurance, getting up at 4AM, etc."""
No Fallacy	Just to point it out, when it's people like Wiles, there's a huge chance of being misled by [survivorship bias](https://xkcd.com/1827/). For every Wiles, there are probably dozens who stuck with the same problem for decades and gained nothing, and hundreds who decided to give up and ended up successful with some other problem.
No Fallacy	"There will not be a better plan than the one we just got. People voted no because they identified a negative and rallied behind it.   Every transit plan is going to have the same negatives.   ""This part of it doesn't benefit me directly""  ""It's going to take too long""  ""But what about space cars""  ""I wouldn't use it""  ""All taxes are bad"""
No Fallacy	"Ah, the combi Straw Man/Ad Hominem again. I think I'll call that a Straw Hominem from now on.  Straw Man because not one single FE including yours truly in almost half a year on this sub, bases their case on ""the bible says so""; and Ad Hominem because it attacks FE but does not address anything they have to say.  Logical fallacies are used by people who don't have a leg to stand on, who thereby lose the debate. Double loser here. Loser."
No Fallacy	Stabbing Faith would save a life she chose to end. Why are Faith fans so into false equivalences? Is it because they know they can't win an argument?
No Fallacy	When has capitalism ever been ethical? During the industrial revolution? The East India Company? I hear the cotton and sugar industries were pretty nice too.   The only reason capitalism is less awful today is because of leftists fighting for our rights.
No Fallacy	Or generalizing based on birthdates is about as reasonable as astrology
No Fallacy	>The problem is that, we never cared about animal consent anyway. We hold them indefinitely in zoo, kill them by millions, force copulation when they are not in heat, take away their children, stick them in cages a meter wide before opening their liver to harvest bile, etc...  All these things are done for a *reason* that somehow benefits us or the animals. We have recognized for a long time that it is wrong to abuse animals...fucking an animal is abuse, so it is wrong.
No Fallacy	Why do you hate atheists? :S you don't know all of them
No Fallacy	You dunno all Christians, so you shouldn't say that. Not all Christians agree with what some pastor of x church say. Even within our own churches we find people with different ideas, perspectives and interpretations of the bible. Therefore, you cannot generalize and think we all think the same way.
No Fallacy	"Anecdotal evidence is what ""A"" is providing to prove the point about hitchhikers.   Cherrypicking is the term for selecting only the evidence that supports your conclusion, though it kinda implies that ""A"" is aware of peaceful hitchhikers and (purposefully or not) ignores them to focus on the murderous one.   I know that this problem, whatever it's called, can be a problem in product development. For example: when designing a smartphone, it's important to consider your market, because some of your users might not have reliable access to electricity -- something you might not consider if you've grown up with immediate and constant access to electricity. "
No Fallacy	Here are a few more logical fallacies. As someone who didn't study this stuff in school, it helped me understand politics a lot better.  https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/659/03/
No Fallacy	I didn't study CS in college, I'm a self taught developer. I'm interested in AI on a casual level, but I don't know much about it and I didn't know what those acronyms meant. 
No Fallacy	"At least based on your retelling of it, the problem I see is that your teacher is inappropriately dismissing complaints as logical fallacies when that does not apply.   ""Circular logic"" and ""begging the question"" are when you start with the assumption that your desired conclusion is true and then make an argument in favor of the conclusion. What you are describing doesn't sound anything like that.  The ""red herring"" argument I guess could apply, depending on the context of the conversation. If someone keeps deflecting conversation away from current problems with the death penalty towards some ideal system where everything is rainbows and sunshine when that's not the point of the discussion, and using this to argue that the death penalty is good, then that could be a red herring. But bringing up secondary argument is not always a red herring.  Neither of these are formal logical fallacies, either."
No Fallacy	I'm pretty sure this is in reference to Pence. I wouldn't exactly hold him up as the standard for normal men, in positions of power or otherwise.
No Fallacy	> So that someone's feelings wouldn't be hurt? Sure, the guy could have flipped out at any point and pulled a knife regardless, but I really believe that he wouldn't have if no one else had gotten involved.  !disagreewithop  This is where you argument fails, because you are downplaying the situation and are asserting how you think a situation would have played out differently. Hindsight makes judging the appropriate response very tricky. We have no idea what would have happened, and to make a guess would be almost pointless. We know that they were confronted, may have been fearing for their life, and these two did what they felt was necessary to aid her. They may not be heroes but to call them idiots is doing more harm to their families. We all react to things differently, and these two obviously felt that attempting to calm the situation was most in line with their beliefs. I'm sure the family understands why they would do this.
No Fallacy	"Telling /r/politics to be rational is such a coin toss. Sometimes the hive mind embraces the rationality, like convincing a man on the ledge of a building not to jump. Other times the hive mind is ravenous, frothing at the mouth, and simply wants to gnash and snarl.  I'm with you. This shit's not okay, but this administration does enough horrible shit that we don't need to sensationalize it. It's already horrible enough by itself.   It's like when organizations with ethically sound goals use unethical practices to further those goals. You're already firmly correct, you don't create more ""correctness"" for yourself, and if you do it usually only ends up hurting your cause more than helping it.  *e* - Looks like it's the latter tonight."
No Fallacy	Also, can we please upvote this instead of just down-voting out of hatred? I would love have a vast conversation on this. 
No Fallacy	This is wildly inaccurate.  The scientific word for marijuana is cannabis.  THC, the chemical responsible for its effects, is called Tetrahydrocannabinol.  The Spanish language has no relation to why it was declared illegal.
No Fallacy	"or currently healing their ""damages"" so created a personal post to be taken as a true, universal experience."
No Fallacy	That is a sweeping assessment.   I'm very close with all of my family. 
No Fallacy	Politely, fuck off with this kind of comment.  Unlike Thanos, who is proud of his accomplishment in wiping out half the universe, Oppenheimers most iconic line (Now I have become death, destroyer of worlds) is about his horror upon what he has introduced to the world. Oppenheimer openly hated the idea of a nuclear weapons and regretted his decisions in helping to create them.  Oppenheimer openly saying hell nuke Thanos when he was against nukes would be akin to having Freud boast about how he mentored Jung, a man who essentially took a look at everything Freud did and went Okay Boomer as a response, being one of the reasons why Freud is considered a laughing stock.  Also, can everyone stop blaming the Patreon Discord? The Discord is a think tank, they arent directly writing the battles. ERB has a dedicated team of writers for that, and maybe like 1% of suggested lines make it from my very limited experience.
No Fallacy	Maybe ask for more examples? Do you think I'm going to write up every moment in history a black person has come across as foolish?

No Fallacy	>The right blames the credit crisis on poor minority homeowners  Fallacy of hasty generalization.  Not all the right blames the poor.  One small sample does not represent an entire population.  Or are you just some left-wing partisan hack who wants to give Krugman a blow-job?
No Fallacy	Funny how you don't seem to object to them spending it on million dollar missiles to fire at random people's wedding parties.
No Fallacy	I was waiting 50 minutes after midnight when finally someone got into our lobby as support Hecarim and we welcomed him between tears and honored him after that 20 mins long game where he went 0/12/1 because we were so happy to finally play a game in our desired roles with our desired champions... Good ol' times bruh
No Fallacy	I've noticed a lot of intelligent and otherwise reasonable atheists use those groups as examples to make blanket statements about religion as a whole. It's really unfair and makes arguing the case hard because if you try to say they don't act like Christians they throw out the No True Scotsman Fallacy, which doesn't really prove anything when you consider there's a little thing called the Fallacy Fallacy.  So while they may not take them seriously, a lot of people with an axe to grind will try to trap you by using them in a argument as if they did. Pretty crappy tactics, but it happens from time to time.
No Fallacy	Looks like BS to me. They should have benchmarked the quantum device against OpenSSL's RAND\_bytes(), or AES in counter mode. For control, they should have also thrown in a not-too-bad stream cipher for which a discriminator is known.   The expected outcome of these additional experiments are: the tests cannot reliably tell quantum randomness from cryptographically strong randomness (created by a deterministic process with unknown state), and they cannot tell stronger from weaker forms of randomness (i.e., the tests fail to achieve what the discriminator does). This means that the results of the experiment do not say anything about the nature of quantum randomness at all.
No Fallacy	"Nobody said it was true.  It's just evidence.  Science doesn't ""prove"" anything... it provides evidence on both sides.  This is simply a news story about potentially new evidence.  It's also a news story written for non-scientists.  Take it for what it is.  Edit (addition): For example, take a look at statistics.  Statistical equations are designed to factor in error.  At no point does a responsible statistician ever suggest there is evidence to prove anything, he/she will simply suggest that there is/isn't sufficient *evidence* to reject null hypothesis."
No Fallacy	I would add the hadith as part of the islamic religion when addressing whether redicule was appropriate, just like shit the pope says is fair game when ridiculing catholics.  so i included the hanging bit, sorry i didn't make that clear.  of course in the same vein... you have to match the criticism to the apropriate denomination.  you can use snake handeling to redicule the pentacostal church of god but you can't legitamately use it to ridicule catholocism.  Hadiths are much the same.
No Fallacy	In what way should we not take the writer seriously? Aren't we missing the mark by relying on Ad Hominem?
No Fallacy	Sagan doesn't really go into history as much as he talks about the history of pseudoscience.  It is better to learn something like the [Trivium method](http://triviumeducation.com/) before doing your own research. The Trivium method gives a great toolset for anybody to learn and research for themselves.  It is also very helpful to learn about [fallacies](http://www.nizkor.org/features/fallacies/), as well.
No Fallacy	Regret. Future regret is also my biggest fear. Crippling sometimes.
No Fallacy	First off only about two lines of dialogue from Krauss were presented in that video.  Hard to take sides when I have no idea what else he had to say.   Secondly, Krauss sounding wrong on something that literally has nothing to do with being an atheist does not in any way mean that he should no longer be used a representative.    This is just pure overreaction to what may of been a poorly made argument by Krauss.

No Fallacy	I get the other examples she posted, but I don't understand this:  &gt;I dont think you realise how fucking lonely it was being one of two brown people in those rooms having to explain why maybe a white woman singing in another language [perhaps a reference to The Preatures song  Yanada] with no black people was a bit fucking problematic.  Is she complaining about the song, because surely it's a positive cultural experience to have a non-Indigenous band learn an Indigenous language and use it in their song?  I looked it up and there's even an [article](https://www.abc.net.au/triplej/news/musicnews/the-preatures/8771564) about how the band went and consulted with the community and wanted to get approval that they were happy for her to sing it.  Maybe that's not what she's referencing, but I can't see what's wrong with that?
No Fallacy	Arguing.

No Fallacy	"The first line of the story literally labels him as a  ""Democratic communications consultant""   Wait, who's leaving things out again? That 'operative' terminology is a dead give away of the narrative conspiracy theorists push at all cost.  Your statement does not square with reality.  >The person filing the suit is a corporate democrat operative. Former Seth Rich spokesman is Brad Bauman. Why cnn leaves that out idk. Or maybe I do. Brad Bauman is a democrat operative. How or why he is/was the spokesman for the Rich family is quite odd or should I say obvious."
No Fallacy	1. How do you ignore a full moon?  2. Shahr means month. Its clearly a time period, not a one-off event (such as a full moon occurrence) 3. Where does God say to start the year with the summer solstice? Please show me the exact wording and the verse number. 4. Keep the shahr in sync with the season - you mean the year. 5. How do you deduce that the year is solar based on 17:12? 6. Did you just copy/paste this view into your mind from Ayman? Its clearly conjecture and also based on mistranslations and misinterpretations. 7. God didnt give us a specific calendar in the Quran.

No Fallacy	I'm happier when I can just pretend that nobody's gullible enough to believe that the economic crisis isn't the fault of both major parties since both are just slaves to corporate interests.
No Fallacy	"From the paper:  *The first known record of the behavioral capabilities of octopuses and their close relatives dates back to Aristotle, who defined octopuses as stupid animals, since their strong exploratory drive made it easy for people to catch them by simply waving their hands underwater (Aristotle, 1910).*  ~~Important to note that I don't believe it's Aristotle the philosopher, though I'm not entirely certain of that.~~ I was wrong, see below! The concept of them being extremely intelligent is largely due to the multitude of papers demonstrating their intelligence since at least the 1950s. This means that most people today would be familiar with their intelligence, rather than the ""stupid"" motion as above.  I found it just as surprising as you!"
No Fallacy	You can prove lots of negatives as long as they are falsifiable.  The God-Claim is set up in a way that makes it unfalsifiable and thus unscientific. But, like you said, you can prove it highly unlikely to a point where the God-Claim is for all intents and purposes as good as falsified.
No Fallacy	"Sort of like it's an ad-hominem attack to casually label Sam's entire audience as ""[his nave, shallow-minded listeners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENtlW-LEqu8&t=6m20s)""."
No Fallacy	Science can't prove or disprove the paranormal. 
No Fallacy	"I know you mean well but ""I have/ have experienced x and I do it, so you can to"" is such a neurotypical thing I hear all the time.  Triggered. Lol."
No Fallacy	Is this the No True Scotsman at work here?
No Fallacy	TEND TO being the operative words here. My husband is a creature of habit who refuses to deviate from the usual path unless absoloutly necessary, whereas I am always looking for better routes and shortcuts.   It all comes down to individuals. Perhaps some men are more gifted at navigation. Perhaps some women aren't risk takers and comfortable being creatures of habit. The article mentions some women were as effective as men at the test, but it did not mention if the reverse was true. Plus, thinking about the way the test was administered suggests many men and fewer women would immediately adapt to the computer simulation, based on their own mention of proficiency with video games being the key to performing well on the test.   It appears that what they really tested was how well you can navigate a computer maze; NOT how well you navigate a car.   
No Fallacy	What about the criminals who aren't child rapists?  What about the men who go to prison because they couldn't pay child support?  What about men imprisoned due to false accusations? What about men in prison due to drugs or theft or anything else non-sexual?  Do they deserve it too? 
No Fallacy	So you don't wanna be called a bigot, but you hate poor people. Great. Good to know. You can't exactly claim moral superiority on that platform, though.
No Fallacy	"> who was exercizing their right to security in their home  No one said that the tenant didn't have the ""right"" to worry about security in their home. The point is that he wouldn't have acted the same way if the ""trespasser"" was white. People wait for their friends in the lobby all the time."
No Fallacy	For the love of God people. Why is everyone forgetting Holly and Nicole also saying they had the same problem to at the veto with a question and that production gave them a heads up as well!? It is not some big conspiracy if Jackson is blatantly talking about it on live feeds. There is plenty of things to not like about Jackson but this ain't one.
No Fallacy	Unlikely  Exactly. Whats already happening? Mass shootings every week. Not a hypothetical situation, a real crisis.
No Fallacy	It's up to you my friend, i'm sorry about that, hope you're better now.
No Fallacy	"No, I didn't go to r/feminism and comment because a)I am not a woman, and b) I generally support the goals of feminism. I posted it here because I follow keto and think it's a useful diet and sub, but also think that some equanimity / moderation is needed.   Now, what I mean by cultish behavior is related to the first point: some people see keto as an end all be all, as a miracle cure for all their ills. This leads them to dismiss anyone who is not ""inside the circle"". It's classic sect behavior. Again, I said some, a minority, but oftentimes, people who are driven by those feelings dominate discussions.   To reiterate: I like the sub, I love the people who post, I relish the inspirational stories. But bad advice, or some sort of ""gate keeping"" actually damages the sub / diet, instead of helping users."
No Fallacy	Congratulations on being the only bisexual user to actually address the problematic side of bisexuality within LGBTQ culture.  Notice how youre the only one in the whole thread. But if a gay guy comes on here and says he doesnt date bi guys, every bisexual subscriber to r/askgaybros is militantly hammering OP down in the comments.  But when theres an example that goes against their perfect narrative, crickets...
No Fallacy	Why shouldnt I let my five year old ride in the front seat of my truck without a car seat nor seatbelt. My generation did it and it was fine. Millennials and Zoomers always making a big deal out of nothing.(Over 1000 children under 13 died in cars annually from the late 70s until 2007).

No Fallacy	So to become a reasonable person, you must be atheist? So, are atheists the only reasonable people? 
No Fallacy	"With such inaccuracies how do we know that any of it is true or not? I suppose this is aimed more at literalists, but to me it seems as though the idea of ""gospel truth"" becomes an ironic statement."
No Fallacy	Carts can hit your car parked in any place. If a person is that inconsiderate they won't care where their cart rolls.
No Fallacy	The first line was no lie, just my observation. One that has shifted a bit from the discussion here. I now noticed that the reddit page mentions you are mostly weak atheists, so I guess that's why...
No Fallacy	This is not analogous at all. Murder is already illegal. So guns don't have anything to do with it. Abortion is the act of killing a human fetus. By this logic, we should be outlawing the tools used to perform an abortion. 
No Fallacy	"So, I have never heard of these guys before, but I got about 10 minutes in and here's my question:  Are they ironically making videos playing the characters of self-righteous, ignorant, post-ironic hipsters, or are actually that? The way they speak and the things they say make them sound like parodies. For instance, one of them says something to the effect of ""I was skipping around because I couldn't watch it because I was so bored.""  They sound exactly like a broscialist caricature I once heard described to me by a woman in Boston."
No Fallacy	Majority of Aleppo city  residents are pro goverment so yes the reactions are genuine.With EG yes it is different though 
No Fallacy	This shit it tough, its not about wanting to watch porn here. Porn addicts dont watch it because they want to, its because they have to to get that fix. Its not about other girls or replacing you either, porn addiction has nothing to do with sex. It only has to be done so you can feel normal again. Like smokers need the cigarette or they get irritated.
No Fallacy	Not to get too political, but a tatted up veteran/biker beating up a handsome Mexican dude is definitely a republican fever dream.

No Fallacy	It's crazy how the purpose of generalization is to generalize.
No Fallacy	I got accused of not one but ~~two~~ *three* logical fallacies, including one I'm fairly sure was made up on the spot. I feel so proud. :D
No Fallacy	"> The comment about SA div teams although not racist was still a bad assumption.  How is it a bad assumption? It's not even an assumption. It's literally an observation based from his dealing with SA teams in the division. He's not assuming anything. Everything comes straight from experience dealing with the teams. He doesn't make any statement saying that's how all teams are like, he just states it's a trend which is nothing but fact.  He doesn't even lump pain with them. He says, ""Although this seems to be a new trend among SA teams it seems that **they** don't know or care about the rules."" If he was generalizing and insulting Pain he would have said you as in ""you people"" grouping Pain along with the rest of SA. But he doesn't do that. He simply states a trend among SA teams."
No Fallacy	And when did I accuse every individual within the community? Still waiting for you to post that.
No Fallacy	That's just a hasty generalization....aka jumping the gun.
No Fallacy	No, but Just saying A.C.A.B doesn't do enough damage 
No Fallacy	Thing is, we as a society make generalizations all the time, but for some reason that isn't ok when it comes specifically to human behavior. We make generalities about weather patterns, about animal behavior, about the health risks of certain foods and medications, about the health risks endemic to certain demographics, etc. All of these are considered valid and no one questions it. But the second we make a generality about data referring to human behavior, everyone loses their minds. I just don't get it. Generalities are not absolutes, they do not imply that absolutely ALL members of any group possesses a given characteristic. It simply means that, generally, group A does action B in situation C. I don't see what is so wrong with that provided there is data to back up a given claim. I think most of the time that people have a problem with generalities, they are actually arguing against an absolute statement rather than a generality. 
No Fallacy	Uhh...I know peaceful Muslims, my God father being one of them.  I know peaceful right wingers who aren't mouth breathers like OP.  You deal with Islamic terrorism with intelligence services. A tiny fraction of Muslims are terrorists.  You deal with white nationalist terrorists like the parkland shooter with law enforcement.  It doesn't always work but that's the cost of living in a free society.  You should be more worried about heart disease, car accidents and other shit before terrorism.  Get a grip.
No Fallacy	You also have to consider that pharmaceutical companies and other businesses essentially cannot make a competitive amount of money by researching food and diet, because it's illegal to patent natural foods. Thus, you don't see a ton of research on the subject, and some of the best data is anecdotal, yet that doesn't suffice in a research setting. 
No Fallacy	I dont give a damn about LGBT, stop pushing your agenda please, Jojo is not propaganda and has no affiliation with the LGBT organisations
No Fallacy	This isn't about the room, is it. There's more to this story...
No Fallacy	"Wtf is wrong with you?  She was raped, and she told nothing just because the rapists were a minority. Its not ok at all, and the only ones we should blame are the rapists and quite possibly her, not the ""Big bad white"". Yes, some whites are racist, but claiming that its all their fault is racism, and towards them  The fact people think that minorities are allowed to perform acts of violence because of racism , or the fear of having racism directed toward them just makes me sad."
No Fallacy	It's this mentality that makes it difficult for women to be taken seriously in professional fields. NTA.
No Fallacy	If this is a science sub then anecdotal evidence should be ignored.   By all means, look at trial results, at the evidence.   Anecdotes are next to worthless.
No Fallacy	There are reasons to believe that invisible pink unicorns are flying around my head.  They're not good reasons, though.
No Fallacy	logic?  his sky daddy raped his mom so that people can symbolically perform acts of vampirism and cannibalism on his zombie corpse because nothing says logic like jesus cheezits.
No Fallacy	Usually, yes, but philosophy has no shortage of highly influential brief statements and aphorisms
No Fallacy	Statistically they dont. Alcohol is the 3rd or 4th leading cause of death and studies show it cuts your life by 30 years on average for those that die from it. Most of the old people I grew up around  smoked so I thought it wasnt that harmful. I just didnt meet/spend time around all the ones that were dead - b/c well, they were dead.
No Fallacy	"Ayos ah. Upvoted generalization.   Di po lahat ng pulis ganyan. Parang sinabi mo na din na lahat ng pinoy tanga. May mga matatalino din naman satin kahit papano.

No Fallacy	If you can impeach Obama you can impeach Biden via association, putting one of god's true people in the White House, where they belong.
No Fallacy	>Saying Obama is a socialist because he believes the rich should pay for the poor is an accurate statement with background and validity.  And this is just an oversimplified mischaracterization.  Adam Smith-- considered by many to be the founding father of free-market economics-- advocated a progressive tax structure in Wealth of Nations. Does this make him a socialist too? 
No Fallacy	Cause most people wearing Che Guevara shirts probably have no fucking idea what the guy actually did or stood for.
No Fallacy	You're right, but just to keep it in perspective, only two are religious studies professors, one of whom is Bart Ehrman, a quack who doesn't do research before he writes his books.  
No Fallacy	If I recall correctly, this subreddit used to disable the downvote feature. The lack of a downvote option is not evidence of a lack of faith among Christians so much as it is evidence for the fact that people on reddit act like dicks sometimes.
No Fallacy	"There's either a [Hasty Generalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hasty_generalization) or a [Sweeping Generalization](http://www.logicalfallacies.info/presumption/sweeping-generalisation/)  A sweeping generalization is applying a general rule to a specific instance (without proper evidence), and a hasty generalization is applying a specific rule to a general situation (without proper evidence).   > ""Black people/people of color can never get skin cancer.""  Think of ""x can never get y"" as a specific rule (Cant get skin cancer) to a general situation (black folk).   > ""All millennials are Lib's/Leftists  ""X are always Y"" Specific rule (Always Libs) to General situation (Millennials)  So Hasty in both  "

No Fallacy	Women dont view short men as good looking ever. Automatically ugly
No Fallacy	There is no room for nuance in anything, so people take one little piece of information and run with it.   After the people were freed, some folks took the time to travel all over the south to interview formerly enslaved people and record their perspectives. One of the more shocking things they commonly expressed was that the worst years of their lives were the ones immediately following emancipation. If you seize on that one little piece and combine it with the stories some people told about the good times they had while enslaved, you can create a false narrative to support your pre-existing desires.

No Fallacy	So if I go to the US and I get shot I shouldn't be mad because its normal there(and a couple of third world countries)?
No Fallacy	Because it happens to be cold today, there is no global warming.
No Fallacy	Just IMHO, alcohol isn't really something we should be consuming. When would we get that in nature? Just because we wouldn't doesn't make it bad...but how is it beneficial?   And if someone 'needs' it to get by in life, to deal with emotional stress or what have you, that indicates a bigger issue that should be dealt with another way.   CBT therapy, for instance, is great.   And no, I'm not saying that people who drink need therapy. But I am saying that habitual drinking or 'getting high' can indicate emotional issues that should be addressed because they can become bigger and can lead to dependence.
No Fallacy	The only thing that gets me with that link is a diet which requires supplements doesn't sound right, can't doubt the rest of it though
No Fallacy	"Your first sentence is bullshit. Just because something is ""plant based"" does NOT mean it is safe to consume."
No Fallacy	"I love the idiocy of ""that can't be natural"", lol even if it was disorder, technically every disorder is natural as these things emerged well from nature lol."
No Fallacy	I never understood this question. Why do people play COD if they don't want to shoot anyone irl? Lol
No Fallacy	Not only is this insane, but it's also insane she thinks every person in a country consumes the same ritual drink every night. This is like saying every single person in the US shoves a McDonald's fry up their arse every night for good luck.
No Fallacy	Does anyone notice changes in their body when they switch up to healthier nutrients? Like before the quarantine I was eating my correct macros but it wasnt the best quality foods. Now Im eating pretty much only good shit and I feel like my physique is looking better and better. Yall know what Im talking about?
No Fallacy	What the fuck is the problem with morons on r/coronavirus?  It's like these idiots hate going to work, or making anything of their lives.

No Fallacy	C-section shaming is a thing now?     Some women just werent born with the right hip and pelvis bones to push out a baby head without a lot of extra difficulty. It isnt their fault.     Without c-sections, there would be a lot more maternal and fetal deaths.
No Fallacy	That's not science!!! Science says that homosexuality doesn't happen in nature, there are only two genders, and that animals don't have sex for recreation.  (All things which natural science has in fact proven to be false assumptions, of course).
No Fallacy	I agree; historically, women didnt chose who they fucked and most sex was rape by modern standards.  But...so what? How is that relevant to modern society?
No Fallacy	Make sure you tell her about other chemicals to avoid. Like water.

No Fallacy	"Naturally I'm all for legalization of psychedelics, but these ""it should be legal because it's natural"" campaigns are really annoying to me. All psychedelics should be legalized whether they occur naturally or not. The fact that something occurs in nature does not make it de facto good or safe. Something can be natural and incredibly dangerous, or synthetic and completely safe."

No Fallacy	Shift to GMO's that have been hybridized to repel insects.
No Fallacy	you have these ethics about killing animals, so you kill plants, as if there are only two forms of life and ethics is the decider of which to kill. i would say its not an informed choice.  the oldest and simplest life forms, of which there are six, can outsmat you and kill you, being alive is a risky business, and ethics wont save you, the name of the game we all play is not 'be the most ethical' you are gonna lose if you dont follow the rules, survive or die, same for everything, even the one celled players get it.
No Fallacy	"I can't imagine the bickering will stop once we get the studies. I mean look at how many studies we have on vegan diets. People will just project themselves onto their pets (""**I am** -- I mean...**my cat** is a CARNIVORE that NEEDS FLESH"")"

No Fallacy	We have collectively decided that a person's life is sacred and taking it prematurely is going against nature or God or whatever morality opposes the idea.   It doesn't mean that life IS sacred, but that is how society has come down on the issue of suicide.
No Fallacy	"""Natural weight""? That's a new one, but I'll actually bite.  What is it exactly that makes it so that the weight you arrive at while sitting on your ass, watching Netflix and eating a diet of *whatever* so much more ""natural"" than the weight you'd arrive at if you, say, worked, ate and moved like our ancestors did?  I don't even mean distant ancestors. A couple generations back will do just fine."
No Fallacy	"I'm all for legalisation of weed, but I hate the whole ""weed can't be illegal/dangerous, it's a natural plant"" argument. As if there aren't loads of highly toxic plants out there  Edit: ffs everyone, I'm not saying weed is dangerous, I'm saying that the fact that it's natural doesn't preclude it from being dangerous and not everything that is natural should necessarily be legal. But weed should be legal, because it's not dangerous, but not because it's natural."
No Fallacy	Early 1900's British philosopher G.E. Moore termed this the Naturalistic Fallacy

No Fallacy	"1) Regulated Markets aren't natural  2) Social Programs aren't natural   3) The ""Capitalist Policies"" we experience aren't true Free Market policies."
No Fallacy	"I had this dude in one of my college classes that would try and justify every misogynistic, homophobic, bigoted opinion he held with ""it's natural.""  So you'd think that'd be an easy argument to shut down, right? I'd say stuff to him like ""There's a lot of homosexuality in nature"" or ""Natural isn't the same as good. Rabies is natural."" And he'd just shrug and say ""Yeah, I guess"" and keep going. Like, he'd sorta agree with me and then just...keep going.  ""I'm an insufferable jackass who refuses to change and uses pseudoscientific bullshit to validate my bigotry"" seems pretty natural too."
No Fallacy	Where I live, there is a famous folklore/tale here of a Wolf and a Sheep.   The Wolf is drinking water from a river. Suddenly he sees a Sheep standing DOWNSTREAM at the same river, drinking water as well.  The Wolf goes to the sheep and tells her that he must now kill and eat her because she made his drinking water dirty by putting her mouth into the same river where he too was drinking water from. The sheep gets very scared but tries to reason with the Wolf and tells him that it was infact him who was standing and drinking water from the Upstream portion of the river and that the river water can only flow downwards as they both can see. The sheep begs him to realize that there is no way that the water that she made dirty standing downstream could flow upstream and contaminate the Wolf's sips. The Wolf kills and eats the Sheep then drinks some more water.
No Fallacy	"""Not controlling this natural thing is controlling""  Wait what the fuck"
No Fallacy	"Just because something is ""natural"", doesn't mean it's harmless. Diabetes is natural. It's most certainly harmful. We've specifically developed modern medicine, to combat harmful health conditions. Pregnancy is one of them. Some choose prenatal care as treatment. Others choose abortion.  Know what's not natural? NICUs. Preterm labor is ""natural"", so I guess it's not harmful, and NICUs aren't Necessary."
No Fallacy	Just because it has the word nature in the name doesnt mean their whole argument is rooted in mushrooms being natural.
No Fallacy	Even if climate change were 100% natural and human activity had no impact on it, it would still be concerning.  I think a lot of people forget that climate change isn't just a weird snowfall in April; it is a challenge to food production all over the globe.  If you eat, you could be concerned about that.
No Fallacy	In what way is this bad. If you have valid criticisms, Ill consider deleting it.
No Fallacy	Eating meat from a store is sbout as manly as arm wrestling an infant and winning.  Even if masculinity is about violence and dominance, you don't get points for anything that poses no risk, threat, or challenge to you lmao.
No Fallacy	Laws can get as arbitrary as necessary in order to maintain a functional society.  For instance littering and loud parties on a week night.  This does not even remotely relate to religion.  A religion like christianity also has no say in ethics, when the bible supports slavery, torture, rape and incest.  Things like murder and rape can be objectively determined to be detrimental to the survival of our species, to us as individuals and to us as a community.  This ties in with our evolutionary history as a social species which includes most of what we consider moral behavior.  Religion is also not necessary for morality.  Finally, the legal system in most countries with a state of law is also not based on the 10 commandments as some claim.  Only killing and stealing have some connection but as we said one does not need religion to punish these things.  The rest are all about god being insecure and jealous.
No Fallacy	Ethnonationalism is not based
No Fallacy	Nothing about her family strikes me as progressive or liberal. They chose a religion thats been racist since its founding. A religion with no history of true social justice.   Im surprised they are even organic farmers.
No Fallacy	I didn't feel like the quiz reflected the discussion board activities or the self-test questions....   significantly more challenging questions. (maybe it's just me, but that chair question threw me for a loop)
No Fallacy	"Of course, everyone is at the mercy of his/her biology, I'm not denying that. The point I'm trying to make using this meme is that how natalists respond to the Antinatalist argument; they try to take shelter behind prescriptive Darwinism i.e. They justify the act of procreation by saying ""this is how we evolved for millions of years and we must continue to do so"".   Almost everyone has an urge to have sex, but does that imply that people should start raping each other and later justify it by saying ""Hey, we have evolved this way""?"
No Fallacy	So does pedophilia, rape, murder, beastiality.
No Fallacy	It really should not be. If youre not cool with your identity being shared, dont play the lottery. Simple as that.

No Fallacy	"Interesting article and thanks for sharing, but let me to be skeptic about:  *"" 3) An invasive species is introduced to a new habitat: Humans move themselves; there is no outside entity facilitating their spread.*    *4) An invasive species had adverse effects on its new habitat and/or on human health: Humans meet this part of the definition in too many ways to count. ""*  If we observe the increase level of [world population](https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/), and we observe in [Google Maps](https://maps.google.com/) how cities and towns are growing their [urban areas](https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2018/mar/19/urban-explosion-kinshasa-el-alto-growth-mexico-city-bangalore-lagos), and all the impacts in climate change especially about the [consumption of natural resources](https://phys.org/news/2020-01-global-resource-consumption-tops-bn.html) , I think it is a possibility to consider humans are invasive species."
No Fallacy	i mean just because we can does not mean we should no? plus isn't it unnatural for an organism to be living that much longer?  look a human lives about 70 years. basically a long enough time to gether resources and care for offspring then pass without causing excessive environmental degradation, and passing on their heritage/culture (hello more people using more finite resources)
No Fallacy	If your good is different from desirable can you tell me how you get to it? Can you define for me why you think individuals ought to act in a certain way?
No Fallacy	&gt; Your father is wrong on several counts.  The biggest one to me is the notion that going against natural instincts is always a bad thing.

No Fallacy	I just dont understand the implication that natural is always better. Their micellar water is 'natural' but the 'natural' alcohol denat in it burned like hell. 
No Fallacy	I'm vegetarian going vegan, but bro. This is just not well thought out. Horses are omnivores and will absolutely eat small creatures. They're opportunistic eaters, not vegan
No Fallacy	is organic really better?
No Fallacy	do you seriously think people have the right to kill a sentient being just because they fancy munching on their corpse..??
No Fallacy	Some people are better-looking. Some people are stronger. Some people play the drums better. Some people are better at making money. Life is not fair.
No Fallacy	It presumes that biology has some sort of 'natural default state' and any opposition is bad somehow. To oppose it would be like opposing all medicine, because you are altering the natural state of things.  It's one of those 'too stupid to logic' arguments that don't really deserve any attention. As a person of biology, I reject that claim.
No Fallacy	With that @ though, its probably because she only, and I mean, only, uses her own doterra oils...
No Fallacy	Yup. Hospital CEOs and Doctors have very little incentive (and desire) to truly help people. It's more about pushing meds and services that cost patients more money, and very little to do with finding and treating the root cause in the most natural, healthy way. Otherwise, they make no money. It's pretty much that simple.
No Fallacy	Jesus didn't talk about a lot of things like necrophilia or rape. Doesn't mean everything he didn't directly say is alright.
No Fallacy	> Genetic manipulation on humans will take decades to get right, and even then it is doubtful we will know what changes truly will result in, The point where the manipulation has a considerable comparison to modern day humans is far away.  This is why this research is so dangerous.  It would be deeply unethical to birth human beings with experimental genetic changes. These babies could wind up with a lifetime of illness and suffering.
No Fallacy	What is an *ethical vegetarian*? The term doesn't make much sense considering vegetarians consume dairy and eggs. Kind of makes the whole ethical part of the term moot.
No Fallacy	That's one thing I don't get they are always going on about those oils being all natural and stuff. So if it's really about things being natural shouldn't that include minimally/not processed at all. That's something those oils are not. So they should use the herbs/plants alone the way they come out of nature (Would probably even be healthier.). But however eating  essential oils is complete nonsense and dangerous.  I do get external uses because when done right they actually can help lessen symptoms for some conditions depending on the oil but they are not even doing that right. (meaning using them pure and shit).
No Fallacy	I would agree with you if things like cancer didn't make us suffer even further in the process.
No Fallacy	There's a chapter in C2D called The Naturalistic Fallacy Fallacy where I deal with this issue head-on.
No Fallacy	"People on Reddit/internet are always so quick to judge and to assume that they would never have done the same thing-- ***hindsight bias****.* People make mistakes... ALL the time. It's not some weird phenomenon that only happens to ""dumb people."" She probably was paying attention, but when you're not prepared for *thin*, metal bars to be protruding in the air in front of you, it could be easy to miss.   And the amount of times people throw in ""natural selection"" for the stupidest things."
No Fallacy	Frankly I wouldnt be surprised if in 5-10 years the fake meat stuff turns out to be causing major problems for people. Most of it is made from things like soy and is highly modified.
No Fallacy	"I could agree on the post (but obviously is a generalization ment for fun).  But the comments about ""evolution"" and how men were the only hunters are hilariously outdated. Its has been proven multiple times that women hunt (and hunted) in gatherer- hunter societies and that the majority of calories consumed come from the gathering."
No Fallacy	Wtf.
No Fallacy	"They claim that ZEFs have the right to life even though that's inside another person, but can never provide a source of these alleged special rights that afford ZEFs the privilege of overriding a cognizant person's human rights. They just revert back to ""it's alive so it's murdering babies, 9 months of inconvenience is nothing so a baby can live"". They seem incapable of grasping the concept of bodily autonomy and consent. If someone is not entitled to enter or touch their genitals without consent, we are entitled to not have a ZEF inside our bodies against out consent."
No Fallacy	Personally I enjoy eating meat, we are all part of the same cycle.  Land Animals, Plants, Insects, Fungus, Fish and other Sea Creatures should be respected and conserved, Not exploited, theres a reason our Ancestors worshiped Animals.  I know the argument that we can survive without eating Animals today, but we can also feed all Animals without them eating each other, so should they be kept from hunting or eating each other because weve invented a way for them to survive without?  This Is Life and We Need to Live by Respecting our Food, Plants or Animals, we should think about them rather than ourselves, by treating them with care and respect they provide us with the Love and eventually the Nutrition We Need.  
No Fallacy	Of course the whole thing is better. Very rarely does something come in nature in a form where you need to extract it for it to be better. Extracts are commonly sold because the stuff is so weak you need to consume copious amounts or because they severely reduce the transport cost and increase profit.
No Fallacy	If all animals are doing this then i guess we can continue to fuck earth-chan's little ass untill she's dead am i wrong? 
No Fallacy	Because of brain chemistry, there will always be insufferable conservatives. About a third of the population experiences really strong feelings of disgust in the brain, about a third experiences mild feelings, and about a third experiences near-zero amounts of disgust when presented with something controversial. I feel that many progressive liberals too easily brush past the substantial backwards voting-blocs in the world. Yes, the arguments used against trans-people now are nearly identical to the arguments used against queer people 30 years ago. But that indicates that *society will always have people resisting change,* rather than that any change is impossible.   The success of a society is not determined by the amount of democratic fairness to the entire population, but by the amount of power granted to that disgust-heavy change-averse part of the population.   **All politics is basically a fight against our own biology**
No Fallacy	Is humanism the logical result of atheism?  Evolution is the only clear purpose weve identified for life.  If you believe in evolution you must believe that humanity should end and superior species emerge.  That doesnt align with much of humanism to me.
No Fallacy	>Discard it like trash and you disrespect the idea of human rights.  An idea is more important than a real live person ?  An idea that nature discards without a. thought
No Fallacy	Many species routinely practice infanticide or rape.  &#x200B;  Maybe we shouldn't be looking to nature for our morality.
No Fallacy	No. Maybe it is in your philosophical system, but there are plenty of others besides yours where it is well defined and not an empty concept.
No Fallacy	I lasted on Statins for one week.  The seventh night I was so cramped up that it was not worth it anymore.   Did the lyfstle  change instead and it is working.  The dose was minimal 5mg a day.  It turns out I have a gene that magnifies the side effects.  Boston health center said I can take Statins according to their DNA test by the way.  I ran my own DNA through Rhondas site to see that Statins dont work for me.  Im taking a natural herb sold by my Cardiologist Bergamot.   The lifestyle change also took me out of prediabitic range. 
No Fallacy	Organic food isn't a reference to carbon content or organic chemistry... But ya, those non-GMO labels on things that don't have G's to ~~O~~ M are always fun. One of my favorite teas proudly advertises itself as 'gluten free' and it makes me just a little sad every time I drink it.
No Fallacy	"> **""Have you ever tried not taking you're medication? I heard it's addictive. Do you think you could stop if you wanted to?""**   Yeah I forget on a regular basis. It majorly hurts my performance at work that day. Do you think an addict ever ""forgets"" that they're addicted?  >""**But that's pretty much coke light, what you're taking, right?""**  Yeah so what? Doctors give out all kinds of interesting chemicals to people who need them. I'm happy to be able to buy a nonaddictive product of consistent quality from a reputable source. My ritalin will never come cut with fentanyl or rat poison. Fuck off.  But no seriously, I don't tell anyone what I'm about, just that I need my ""medicine"".  I use that word to cover everything from a wrist brace to advil to albuterol."
No Fallacy	Idk why people haven't been able to except that. 
No Fallacy	"I liked this part:  >""and his long, tortured description of lobsters in his book 12 Rules to demonstrate natures male hierarchies (ignoring a vast number of matriarchal species)""  How can people still get the lobster concept wrong? "
No Fallacy	"""Affordable health solution""...... affordable my ass and it's no health solution. Tell your boss that it's a load of crock "
No Fallacy	"I think people get so caught up on the idea that the only ""difference"" that counts is some sort of final idealistic goal where the entire world lives in harmony, or something.  Instead, I always think of the story about saving starfish on the beach. *It matters* to the ones who are saved."
No Fallacy	Even if property is a social construct, you would need to make the argument that whatever is natural is good (AKA desirable), and then you would have to accept things like rape being good or neutral because nearly 50% of all animal sexual interaction is rape.     Furthermore, many people assume authority is the power to influence another person's behavior -- which can be anything along the lines of being imposing, holding a firearm to someones' head, or hurting someone until they give in to your demands.
No Fallacy	"Well based on polls, the anti vaxx community is much more common in right wing communities. Mainly evangelical ""all natural"" groups.  The reason we think otherwise or that it's more even is that the most publicized cases are left wing Hollywood elites espousing these beliefs."
No Fallacy	I fucking hate the argument that something is 'unnatural'. Whether or not something is natural (which isn't really well defined in the first place) places no moral bearing on whether or not we should do it. Vaccines are unnatural by the same logic, but if you use that as an argument against it you are a loon.
No Fallacy	"The essence of capitalist realism. The belief that capitalism is the default system that people revert to when they're given total freedom. Anything else supposedly needs to be maintained through external force. In truth, capitalism can't survive without exploitation, violence, and domestication. It's not the, ""natural"" way of doing things, quite the opposite. If you torn apart the state and made everyone the rational, *Molon Labe*-type egoist that right-libertarians tend to admire, capitalism would collapse quickly."

No Fallacy	He didnt say leg hair is like a tumor, he said the argument you used to justify leg hair is invalid because you can use it to justify tumors. Sheesh
No Fallacy	Yes, the US doesn't require dog food to be nutritionally complete. Ask your vet if your dog food is okay. If you want to make your own dog food try to find a few recipes online and then them by your vet. If you're not sure about something for yourself or pets defer to what a LICENSED expert says, don't feel about about seeking a 2nd opinion form another licensed expert if you feel like the 1st says something that seems really wrong. Ultimately conventional wisdom can fail us so don't search for an expert that agrees with you, just one who is qualified.   Disregard what u/tmimus7MT said it isn't supported by experts in dietics.
No Fallacy	He claimed hierarchies are natural, since we can trace hierarchies to lobsters.
No Fallacy	"One thing I find incredibly frustrating in the nature/nurture debate is how many leaning towards the nature side sometimes seem to assume that ""socialisation"" or ""social construction"" is something that happens at random in a vacuum without any connection to material circumstances. So then ""every society on earth has been like this"" suddenly becomes an argument for why something is innate or unchangeable.  This especially toxic in discussions about feminism where I've seen so many arguments that are basically ""every society in history has been a patriarchy and that's why we have to keep it that way"""
No Fallacy	Bad proposal: relocate all nursing homes into the shadows of coal power plants so that the particulates are breathed in by people who are no longer returning much value to the economy and the disproportionate political activity of the elderly can be harnessed towards completing the elimination of coal.  More seriously:  If we can shift towards lab-meat, we can further reduce particulate outputs from agriculture, thus helping to clean up the economic reward profile of agricultural activities.
No Fallacy	"> Wants to force everyone to stop using nuclear energy and replace it with the inferior, inconsistent, and environment-damaging solar and wind energies because they're ""renewable"" and ""natural"".  Out of everything they do, this is probably the most infuriating one to me. **Objectively** nuclear power is the best source of energy we have. It produces no CO2, thus it doesn't contribute towards the climate change. It works 24/7 at incredible efficiency. It requires very little non-fossil fuel compared to the energy output, and the energy output is fucking massive. Yet, these absolute brainlet mongoloids are completely against it for reasons so incredibly retarded even my shriveled raisin of a brain can't even fathom the depths of their stupidity. Nothing makes me hate a person faster than the moment they come out as anti-nuclear energy."
No Fallacy	Can we get a translator in here?
No Fallacy	My experience at university in the UK was a bunch of students trying to tell me that cannabis isnt really a drug. No matter how much I tried to tell them that it was, they just werent having it because its just a plant.
No Fallacy	"It is, but not really for the farmers who have more expenses and yet can't sell it for the price of bio milk, because they miss the seal. Would make more sense to sell bio milk for less money (even though still more expensive than ""normal"" milk..."
No Fallacy	Natural and organic doesn't mean safe or non-toxic: urushiol, the chemical in poison ivy, is natural and organic.  There's incredibly safe synthetic chemicals and there are toxic naturally occuring ones.  The notion that something that is natural is safe is incorrect.
No Fallacy	Your paycheck has nothing to do with whether your job is essential or not.  Your paycheck only says how difficult you are to replace. Ambulance drivers are essential personnel yet they're easy to replace, which is why they make only 20 bucks an hour.  Celebrities are clearly not essential personnel but they're next to impossible to replace, which is why they make $20,000 an hour.
No Fallacy	I love humans and they are animals.   When bears go vegan, I'll follow suit. In the meantime, I'll happily exist in moral equivalence with the bears. 
No Fallacy	2019 may then be the year we find out about all the unintended consequences of eating things grown in a lab, not via natural systems.  Remember when they told us fat was bad and sugars were fine? Same agenda here.
No Fallacy	>I see a lot of vegans claiming that a vegan diet is 'natural'  Really? I find the appeal to nature comes from omnivores usually. The good ol' 'Lions tho' argument. 
No Fallacy	According to whose moral system? As far as I'm concerned, I'm obligated to have children. Claiming anything is immoral or moral without stating which system we're using to evaluate that is absurd.
No Fallacy	"If you don't use food to suppress your appetite, then you just end up eating more in the long run. Deprivation is what leads to bingeing and overeating.   You don't need ""portion control,"" for we have portion control inside of us that tells us when to stop eating. Some of us are just more in tune with our internal hunger/fullness cues than others, and those who aren't could become more in tune with their hunger/fullness cues with practice.   You can't create a ""diet plan,"" for our bodies do not need the same amount of calories each day. The only way we could know how much we need to eat that day is by listening to our internal hunger cues.   Telling people not to eat and not to satisfy their hunger is what leads to overeating and health issues. "
No Fallacy	You joke (or maybe not), but the lions wouldn't have more right to the area than the human, and is just as much a killer to local species.
No Fallacy	Wow, can you teach us - enlightened centrist - how you transcended teams and are now, wise and enlightened and teamless?
No Fallacy	You are aware that animals have to sustain themselves through food right. Like should we register lions for eating zebras. It is the natural order of things but maybe you are right people should have to register for breathing too why not? Humans dont eat dogs because for a long time they have a had bond for hunting and survival. It is an unspoken rule. Not only this but the definition of abuse is    treat with cruelty or violence, especially regularly or repeatedly.  If you kill a dog it isnt really abuse it is killing that is why killing animals doesnt count as abuse
No Fallacy	I honestly believe humans place such a high value on zygotes/fetuses etc due to us having evolved a parental gene to invest a lot into parenting our offspring. Since those that actually cared about their offspring ie had a mutation of parental gene, their offspring were more likely to survive and pass the gene on.   So its basically in our DNA to be protective and place a high value on anything seen as offspring. Which pregnancy is seen as offspring.   I dont think its really related to anything vague like potential future of the fetus etc I think the underlying thing is the value humans place on our offspring. Otherwise if they didnt value it they wouldnt even be thinking of potential future etc.  So i think its like Strong parenting nature due to genes = high value on offspring/fetus = thinking of it in many different ways to try and cognitively justify its value.
No Fallacy	Corpses are food, objectively speaking. In fact, although humans aren't part of it, an entire class of animals exists that survives by eating corpses. These are called carnivories. Corpses are such effective food that even animals which aren't traditionally considered carnivores, such as deer, cows, and horses, will eat a corpse if it's convenient. Such effective food that early humans  hunted large animals to near extinction. Regardless of your views on eating meat, if we're going to call all meat a corpse (which is fair, I suppose) then yes, corpses are actually an incredibly viable food.
No Fallacy	Welcome to all of life  Edit: Why are you booing me. Im right
No Fallacy	from an evolutionary perspective, a very dumb idea. Ensuring survival of the species (procreation and adaptation) goes against killing our own.  from a scientific perspective, lol. We can communicate to each other thankfully (in case you didn't notice) and have other ways to probe our system (ultrasound, MRI, XRays, etc) so performing an autopsy to gather data is not only unnecessary, just very ignorant to propose.  from a legal standpoint, buddy go read some before asking these type of questions again.
No Fallacy	"""I think mankind must learn that nature takes back the part of earth which mankind should not have taken.""  The Earth is sentient?"

No Fallacy	Humans are the baddies we arent the dominant species because we are nice to everything here. We literally are the baddies to everything not human on this planet and often not even that stop us.
No Fallacy	There exists a social phenomena(I forget the name) whereby if you see that other people agree with something (i.e vote yes on a poll) you are more likely to also vote yes on that poll because humans instinctually like to be on the winning side  By showing poll results while the poll is running, many people will simply vote for the winning option(especially if theyre uninformed on the topic) because its winning so it doesnt matter or if these ppl agree with it its probably right, or if they disagree with the winning option, they wont vote at all because they dont think it matters  By hiding them, people will be more likely to either abstain from voting on things theyre not informed on, or do research and vote for the thing they actually agree with
No Fallacy	Gets my upvote because it's unpopular.  Scientifically, it's also false. Attractiveness is linked to averageness. If you morph the photos of 20 men or 20 woman you get an extremely attractive fictional man or woman. Mixing racial backgrounds has the same effect. It eliminates prominent features while inbreeding does the opposite. So usually, people with a diverse background are more attractive.
No Fallacy	&gt; all of the 'facts' presented by the activists were pretty much ignorant, emotionally driven rage.  That's the roadmap: use emotional appeals and get an angry mob to shout down anyone with the gall to disagree.  The difference now is that they're doing it in House chambers. 
No Fallacy	The obvious counter to this is simply that people do still invest in these games despite the fact they can buy games like Mashup that come will all the cards already. I tend to assume that most consumer bases arent irrational, so there must be something appealing about the model.  Part of the fun of TCG is collecting the cards. Its a trading card game specifically because are meant to also enjoy trading the cards.People wont be able to enjoy that aspect of game if all cards were easy to get. Part of the fun of building a deck is going out and hunting for the perfect addition. If everybody could that card, it wouldnt be as special and would make the game bogged down because everybody would be running the same five cards.

No Fallacy	"Stuff like this confuses, me, so honest question:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Exodus  &gt; The consensus of modern scholars is that the Bible does not give an accurate account of the origins of Israel, which formed as an entity in the southern Transjordan region by the 13th century BCE.  Of course, modern scholars could be wrong, all the evidence could be a misunderstanding, etc. But the same is true for Mormonism's problems with modern archeology as well. Why does one ""sting"" while the other does not?"
No Fallacy	&gt;proponents of this belief don't understand that currency is a medium of exchange  &gt;Crypto's sole real value... is it's use as an exchange medium  Pick one.  &gt;In summary cryptocurrency is a technologists wet-dream that has no purpose in being implemented without state endorsement which would give it actual value.  Well, the point for many enthusiasts is that it would allow us to *divorce* our medium of exchange from not only the government, but any centralized institution. You can make the argument that this is a pipe dream, but you'll have a harder time making the case to a crypto guy that this is a bad thing.  &gt;And no saying that if that's what the market lets happen it must be good is not a valid argument.  Not sure I get what you mean here. if the market finds it valuable, you can't just say that doesn't count.

No Fallacy	NTA and this is one of those times when it's clear that Reddit isn't a representative sample of adults. For the love of God, I'm extremely liberal. Most of my friends are also very liberal, and the ones who have kids would absolutely not be ok with polyamorous PDA around their kids. It's confusing, it could cause the parents to have to answer a lot of awkward questions, and there's no reason for the gf to come, because she's not family. She's not even long-term yet.

No Fallacy	&gt; 2 Peter   It's relevant only because it is typical of the excuses Christians have to come up with to explain why Jesus was wrong.  It certainly doesn't explain anything, because how long a day is has nothing to do with whether any of the people listening to Jesus are still alive and waiting for the last judgement.    Just by the way, it's also the work of a 2nd-century liar who only claimed to be Peter, according to almost all non-Fundamentalist scholars.

No Fallacy	&gt; he's still a fantastic interviewer.  There's something a bit preening about his interviews. Just the way he constantly turns it back on himself and a story about himself. There's something vaguely narcissistic and cold about the way he approaches certain interviews.   So, I don't find him to be a particularly good interviewer. Not as bad as Corden, though.  EDIT: Down vote button isnt for simple disagreement but whatever. Argumentum ad populum doesnt necessarily prove anything either.

Based of this 3K has had a peak of 124,334 and Warhammer II had 111,909, that isn't that huge of a difference. And both Warhammer games we exceedingly well liked at release, so saying 3K blows everything else away is a bit of a stretch.  Yes it's a great game, but not the first great game Relic has produced.
No Fallacy	If the vast majority like it, why does crucible have now twitch viewers? Why are Bungie revamping crucible in September if its fine as it is? Why did they remove trials if everyone liked it? Why does this thread have so many upvotes?
No Fallacy	Refusing to listen to reason and logic because more people believe you than the other
No Fallacy	"You should change your username to ""everyone hates me"". Because with shitty comments like that, it's definitely true"
No Fallacy	"Lmao ""look at the upvotes, I'm right"" that's some next level bullshit"
No Fallacy	Bandwagon hating on something in general is a huge problem.  I try to make a point to have a full explanation of why I dislike something before I go hating on it. Also, I am open to debate said dislike.
No Fallacy	Is this a joke comment? The Catholic Church has been found guilty (by a court of opinion at the very least) of harboring, supporting, hiding, maintaining and sometimes promoting pedophiles. They should ***never*** be allowed to forget the vile and evil breach of trust they inflicted on the parishioners they vowed to God to serve. The parishioners who trusted them.   Why do *you* think they wanted children in those roles? Hmmm...let me see...  I'll take your downvotes as a hypocritical affirmation of the churches desire to hide the truth and control the narrative. There has to be a line folks - If pedophilia is not *that* line then all is lost.
No Fallacy	Argumentum ad populum
No Fallacy	God, what a shit show, yet another example of the frightening mediocrity of our modern political leaders. I was in Scotland when this clusterfuck began and I would not be surprised if it ends up with a independence for them, one of the big promises that the anti-independence side has in the last referendum was Britain being in the EU. The whole of Scotland voted for remain, so I wouldnt be surprised to see a re energized independence movement after BrExit.
No Fallacy	I like the way this picture makes it look like exactly 27 people read this exchange and had exactly the same response.

No Fallacy	STK: STC is really toxic, they bullied the actors  Also STK: *the post*  I guess it's only okay to not bully people if they have earned millions of dollars and are rich.  Also I find it funny Mauler had millions upon millions of views, and a crap ton of likes... but no he's a clown
No Fallacy	"Obviously with the police crawling all over the place, *something* is up.   Referring to that something as ""it"", doesn't seem weird to me at all. A kid like Brendan saying something like, Is my uncle Steve an official suspect in any suspected foul play?  That would be weird.  You *refuse* to act like Brendan's intelligence makes any difference whatsoever in how he processes and attempts to express the events around him.  People have been tearing your shit up for days on this sub.  And I think it is awesome that you're still waiting for the 'OMG, that stoically contrarian /u/reed79 tenaciously fought against the tide of ignorance, and now Ken Kratz can go back to shepherding society back to justice unbesmirched!' post."
No Fallacy	They're advertising a feature, not arguing that their product is a physical law of the universe.  It's senseless to invoke logical fallacies over questions like whether you enjoy carrots.  I'm just trying to help you to not look foolish.
No Fallacy	"Why are people always under the impression that because most people approve of it, it should be here? I've seen the same on Stack Exchange ""No, this question was good, it has upvotes, it should not be closed, people approved of it! - It was yet another what-library-should-I-use-question..."", and one of the worst offenders in this regard was/is Hacker News.  After all, this subreddit *is a dictation* until stated otherwise, it is also about Linux and not about websites providing source hosting. Also I don't see any valuable discussion going on in the original submission, seems more like people were preparing for a witch hunt."

No Fallacy	> I don't quite understand why we make the mistake of confusing influence and correctness on specific issues.  It's called Doxa.  > Moreover, I don't understand what citing specific thinkers is expected to show instead of appealing to a consensus.  Because a consensus isn't automatically more reliable; per Argumentum ad Populum, Echo Chambers, Circular Reporting, System Justification and Narrative Continuations.  If an individual has a good argument it matters regardless of it's social acceptance.  If an incorrect individual influences a consensus, that also matters.
No Fallacy	I don't like Horizon very much, but the game is definitely not trash, it's a glorious mainstream game. Never mix up your personal opinion of game with the overall quality for the target audience.
No Fallacy	First off if you base anything off it's popularity then you are fucked.
No Fallacy	"TL;DR? Becouse I'm sick or reading all those ""genre is dead/deing, what went wrong?"" missinformation atricles. While MMORPGs are earning more than ever before, and there is large spectrum of games available providing different expiriences for players liking different things."

No Fallacy	"Don't know the technical name but whatever's called when someone says something which goes against general knowledge therefore it not being true is not a matter of objective reason but of personal opinion   Like ""I believe that pigs can fly because there's no serious scientific research on the subject and just because some people saw a pig fall off a cliff and die it doesn't mean it applies to all pigs"""
No Fallacy	People just use casual fan as a vague term to support their argument when they don't have anything else 
No Fallacy	popularity does not make a thing right or wrong.
No Fallacy	"This is an *argumentum ad populum*, (Latin for ""argument to the people""), which is a fallacious argument that concludes that a proposition must be true because many or most people believe it, often concisely encapsulated as: ""If many believe so, it is so.  Regardless of what Donald and the right wing want you to believe, television ratings, or the results of opinion polls, do not determine what is and what is not the truth. They are trying to move the argument out of the courts of law where the facts according to verified evidence determines the results, and into the court of public opinion, where emotions and preconceived biased beliefs hold sway. "
No Fallacy	Argumentum ad populum?
No Fallacy	"That's a pretty big ""thus"" you've thrown into the mix there. If this was just people getting details mixed up, the Mandela Effect would not sustain the interest it has. "
No Fallacy	My OP was up to about 10 net upvotes (even at 60 approval), and then r/debateevolution mentioned it, and now I've been downvoted to zero.  Too funny.  At least I got 373 views.
No Fallacy	people who get pissy about team orders must be recent fans because the history of F1 is jam-packed with team orders.  It's not fun to watch and it's not ideal, but they're fighting for championships.  Their job is to do everything they can to secure that championship.  People have lost championships at the end of the year because their team had decided earlier in the year *not* to give team orders.  Like soccer players who fall when they're breathed on, it's lame but It's also just part of the game.
No Fallacy	I don't have time to respond to all of this right now. However, most of what you wrote is untrue, half the story or attempting to take 2000 year old symbolic books at face value. Also, there is no debate about whether Jesus existed. Many Roman historians wrote of him at the time and he was at the very least a rabbi who had a massive following.   Edit: I'll give a detailed response later

No Fallacy	"It's to show that the claim is nothing new.  It's something that has been around and followed by other people for at least 2000 to 3500 years, which is historically significant.    In other words, it's a way of say ""this is just not my opinion""."
No Fallacy	> No they havent, they make a bunch of shitty action comedies that bandwagoners love  That's all you need to know folks. We're wrong for enjoying something he doesn't like.
No Fallacy	Also, if everybody OP knows at church thinks socialism is bad maybe OP should consider the fact that they might be wrong.    
No Fallacy	I support you. I keep getting harassed by him too. I thought reddit was about civil discussion not out right harassment, ad hom attacks on character, and censorship from the mods from giving any feedback.  **I created a poll to see if the users on** r/zen **have a problem with quote spamming and it was taken down within 5 mins. This just demonstrates the mods are afraid to find their opinion to be in the minority.** When I message why it got taken down I get no response. My question to the mods then is what are they afraid of? That most people hate the copy paste character assassinations? That most people don't conform to their opinion of Zen? That they just like the idea of being a mod and don't want to put in the proper effort to better the community?

No Fallacy	"I hate this argument in all forms. Words and terms mean whatever people think that they mean. They don't have secret, subconscious meanings that people are using without realizing. ""Cultural marxism"" is just a scary-sounding phrase that connotes leftists taking over culture the same way that marxists (leftists) took over government. That's all it means or needs to means to the people who like to use it."

No Fallacy	Wait what's summits view on all this. He's the only streamer I actually really liked but if he's being an idiot about this too I'd like to cancel my sub to him now rather than give him anymore money
No Fallacy	I think you missed the point of the video. He was using its popularity as a point of view to bring up the drop in quality and why the quality dropped. This of course was a result of the author repeating story arcs and the demanding schedule required not only as a manga artist but as one trying to stay in Jump every week.  Yes popularity is not synonymous with quality but he was using the popularity as a starting point to bring up these reasons for its drop in quality.
No Fallacy	Isn't that argumentum ad populum, as well as a violation of professional psychiatric ethics?
No Fallacy	NO! This is *programming*, it's gotta be all-or-nothing, all the time! Nuance is for arts majors.  /s
No Fallacy	"I try not to do this because it's so patronizing, but sometimes it's also so true.   ""Sorry, Barbara I didn't mean to treat your relationship like it doesn't count. You're going to be in a polyamourous relationship with three guys in a punk band *forever* and I shouldn't talk about it like it's a phase.""   ""No, Jim, I think dropping out of business school to try to be a rapper is a great idea.""   But the reality is, most people Jim and Barbara's age understand the things that Jim and Barbara don't. It's not their age, it's their experience.    Edit: LOL, the comments I'm getting that are basically, ""Whatever, man! Jim *will* be a famous rapper, you just don't understand because you're old. I've been to enough college to know that you have no empirical evidence that Jim won't be a famous rapper, but not enough life experience to know how dumb I sound saying that."" "
No Fallacy	You say that like this shit is made up or something. Some conservative Christians really believe bullshit like this.
No Fallacy	Out of genuine curiosity rather than picking a side, what do you have to say about both sides crediting Trump for the peace? What's your counterargument to that?
No Fallacy	Everyone fits into boxes, just sometimes they're boxes with only one person in.  Politics isn't broad-strokes. It's extremely individualized. This is why I don't get along with many leftists despite being very far left myself.
No Fallacy	It's becoming more and more obvious to me that we are all just being trolled and no one actually believes the earth is flat. 
No Fallacy	This the same attitude white supremacists have, and honestly its sickening.  More diversity is ALWAYS a good thing.  European countries as well as the United States are becoming more ethnically diverse by the day.  Israel needs to step up.

No Fallacy	"It is not ""absurdly passive aggressive"" to ask people to read an article you've written before criticising the contents of the article. I have seen zero instances in this thread where /u/nlitherl has even mentioned the financial aspect of his work.   I'm tempted to say this is a breach of rules 1 and/or 4, but I suspect that'd have a chilling effect on good-faith but poorly reasoned criticism, which is a learning opportunity, and that's not something I want to chill."
No Fallacy	"I mean... if enough people get sick doing this shit maybe they'll learn not to do it? ""Dog's mouth is cleaner than human's"" is their absolute belief. So ...if making out with dogs makes you sick, and letting a dog lick you can end up with you losing your arms and legs, how is it that dog's mouth is ""cleaner"" than a human's? I guess this is what it takes to get that stupid myth out of their heads, finally."
No Fallacy	"Mine was like a cornered animal, always having to defend herself from being called out for lying/manipulating. She would invoke ""god"" and claim he was on her side too. She was funny, because she claimed no memory at all of the more recent abuses she perpetrated, yet could recall a ten year old lie she told and apologize profusely for it (rare, I know- but this was because she was caught 100% in the lie, and had no other option that time.)  My theory is that when they claim a god is on their side, it's just more ally gathering. Just like when they claim that ""(unnamed) people are saying..."" or speak for people who are not present just to bolster their own argument. Sides were important to mine. They thought that if they could say one or more people agreed with them, then you lost the argument. This was Ndemocracy, you see. "
No Fallacy	Generally the people arguing against it are both conservative and religious (usually christian).  They willing believe 2 million people marched through the desert for 40 years and didn't get noticed or leave anything behind, but when it comes to climate change they reject science.  You aren't dealing with rational people.
No Fallacy	Rule utilitarianism seems pretty good to me, so long as the subject can define a clear majority, but what about a scenario where the population is truly split on an issue?  If the people were completely split 50/50 on, say, gay marriage, how can we use this philosophy to decide what is the right thing to do? What about 51% against, 49% for? Is the 51% right just because more people have been swayed to it?
No Fallacy	The question that always comes up is what constitutes as undeniable? Many of us thought there was undeniable evidence that Russia hacked the DNC but there is still a large constituent of people who believe it was made up.   The only thing these days that's undeniable is audio or video recordings. Without those, you're not gonna change anyone's minds. Heck, even after the access Hollywood tapes came out nobody changed their minds about Trump. 
No Fallacy	Bron fans don't hate Kobe nearly as much as Kobe fans hate Bron. I think it's because most would say lebron has surpassed Kobe so lebron fans don't feel as threatened by Kobe as Kobe fans are by lebron.

No Fallacy	This is the dissenter list with the response called [Project Steve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Steve), just FYI.
No Fallacy	I see where you are going, but bad example. There are different levels of morally bad and I don't think suicide bombings and eating meat are even close to the same level of bad. I gave the example of lying about how a pie tastes above. That would be similar in my mind. Rewrite your little scenario:  > I think it is morally wrong to lie about things and won't change my view on that. Despite believing that, I still lie about liking my mom's pie. Everyone I know lies about little things like that. I was raised doing that. My significant other lies to me about whether or not she can tell I lost weight. To avoid supporting lying would make my life significantly more difficult. I don't know how to live life without telling at least small lies. My mom would be crushed if she found out I hated her pie. 
No Fallacy	Moral realism is a majority view among philosophers. According to the philpapers survey 56% accept moral realism [Source](https://philpapers.org/surveys/results.pl)
No Fallacy	You know what you're right. Why should I believe an entire international body of scientists and a forest's worth of research papers? Some guy on reddit said it's not true so it must be so.
No Fallacy	&gt;Zetterman said that when he was training, I dont know that anyone ever thought about whether we were physically well or mentally well.  Oh ok. Guess that means we should never care about things that people didn't used to care about. Idiot.

No Fallacy	Bit overkill now 
No Fallacy	Please don't use past conventions to support ones right now. It was also a lot more moral to openly discriminate against PoC and kill LGBT+ people 70 years ago. Punching Nazis as self defense against preaching violence has nothing to do with it being moral 70 years ago.

No Fallacy	I have no problem with that tbh - if you want to be partnered with a corp, they tend to hold you to certain community standards.  I think it's a bad move since gamers don't like that shit, but it's still common and imo fine.  If they start to exert more control like this over standard servers they can go fuck a goat.
No Fallacy	When I tell people horse racing is cruel, they tell me it's a tradition that we can't get rid of.   No matter how many articles I see about record deaths at a race weekend, breeders who use illegal electric whips, or how, despite an incoming ban on advertising betting during live sports in the UK, horse racing will be exempt because it's run by the betting industry, so many people just don't seem to care.

No Fallacy	[i think the society should be already decayed at this point then](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_prostitution)
No Fallacy	Tradition?
No Fallacy	Most of these answers go back to tradition, and that it was part of the society at the time. My question in parallel to this subject is; why was Jesus subject to these cultural beliefs? It is also very commonly stated that God is unchanging, would it therefore be accurate to say jesus's unchanging? And if the answer is yes, would he still agree with religious sacrifice, even though it's not accepted in today's society?
No Fallacy	Not to discourage VPNs in any way, quite the opposite actually, but from what I understand is that these protection laws aren't even active yet, so we can't lose what we never had. You've always been at risk.
No Fallacy	Chances are good that Google actually supports this. However...  They are required to support this. Google is primarily an advertising company; they understand public opinion. They understand the cost of not having that line there. The simple fact of them doing nothing while everyone else comes out in support for the idea would cost them way too much. So we'll never really know what they think.  This is the problem I have with most celebrities. Even if they voice an opinion I agree with, I just assume that some agent or PR person told them to say it and it indicates nothing about what they actually believe.
No Fallacy	"&gt;The tradition isn't what makes it right, the tradition lasting this long is simply evidence of it being right.  Is this their new angle now? Doesn't that mean all manner of things are likely to be ""right,"" considering how long humanity has committed actions which were either stupid or horrible?"
No Fallacy	"CTRL-F ""Toyota""  Oh thank Christ."
No Fallacy	I think the real pro tip is only buy a ring you can afford without financing. My wife is traditional and wanted a diamond. I bought her some like .3 kt diamond. It's very small and she's happy. I spent 300 in total on the ring.   Others I know have used various rocks due to personal preferences. I don't know anyone who's had to finance a ring or has bought a ring that was worth more than 500.   I believe you should be happy upfront, so do spend a little. In theory, it should last you your entire life, so it should be special. But going into debt is starting a marriage on a bad note.  Do what works for the two of you. And be sure to shop around. Diamonds are pretty vanilla, and there are so many other flavors you can have, so why settle if you don't have to.

No Fallacy	"When has he ever argued solely from the point of ""god said so""?  I've seen hundreds of hours of his programs and I've never seen it.  "
No Fallacy	How is he racist
No Fallacy	Anyone who non-sarcastically starts a sentence with back in my day is probably about to try to justify some dumb or terrible shit based on tradition instead of reasoning. Back in my day, women knew their place, there were no blacks in this city, you didnt have to press 1 for english etc
No Fallacy	"""Different perspectives""? It's conservatism. The whole concept is maintaining traditional cultural, legal, and economic values. They're the political equivalent of fanboys. Anything new that others want to enjoy somehow ruins what they already have."
No Fallacy	Yes, have you ever heard of cannibalism? Morality is relative to the society, and outside members have no objective right to life.
No Fallacy	I don't understand, do people here really believe that automation won't cause mass unemployment just because it hasn't in the past?
No Fallacy	None of this matters, it's all a moot point. The cat is already out of the bag when it comes to gun control in this country.
No Fallacy	Yes, there are traditions that should be upheld, and others not so much. The problem is where to draw the line.
No Fallacy	When women start buying magazines filled with pictures of men's nipples this argument will make sense
No Fallacy	Do we eat cats and dogs tho?? no. cows and pigs are cattle, they are food, cats and dogs are rodent exterminators, its just nature. 
No Fallacy	"Have we just won the right to use the argument ""we've been doing VEGANISM since literal ages"" now?"
No Fallacy	You can tell this article is trash because it says something weird happened in reference to a judge being appointed.   This has been the case for nearly every Georgia justice in recent memory.  Also, using descriptives like weird and scheme are things to look for to determine how true-to-fact a news source is. Absolutely not the only thing, but its a start.   Voxs explanatory journalism is just a different way of saying we are biased.
No Fallacy	Ive seen this floating around in the liberandu wilderness. What are the sources backing each claim?   (The Farhan Akhtar argument of a lot of people are saying this so it must be true is not a valid source)
No Fallacy	Isn't the point to try and make the system easier to learn in the first place.  I feel like we sometimes get bogged down with *We've always done it this way* vs trying to make it more palatable to someone who is just starting out.  I think a lot more people would join if it was.  
No Fallacy	&gt; Will never understand people who buy these overpriced mini-lootboxes for real money.  As someone who always pre-orders, I don't see packs as loot boxes but rather as card packs. Back in my day, when card games were physical, believe it or not, we bought many of them... because part of the game (for me at least) is to collect and complete. Nobody ever said that playing a card game is a cheap hobby, well it might be cheaper than collecting funco-pops or however they called.
No Fallacy	"Yes, and the people who don't learn. ""Well, that's how I was raised and I turned out ok"" excuse when a parent does something totally shitty to their kid (beating them or forcing them to eat, or other stuff) just makes me want to slap the snot out of them, because, no, you didn't turn out ok, because you are just as bad as your parents were."
No Fallacy	YTA some traditions need to be retired. Just because you have done it forever doesn't make it right
No Fallacy	Its the space bar because thats how it worked in chivalry, dodge should not be good, its cancer
No Fallacy	"There's a number of things,but I think the main disagreements can be boiled down to ""systemic risk"" and ""Unix Philosophy"". When there's a problem in SystemD, stuff is broken."
No Fallacy	Is there something wrong with being a conservative?
No Fallacy	Um, no. I prefer argumentation to appeals to emotion. 
No Fallacy	Just because its (currently) an accepted practice in some countries doesn't mean it's suddenly not genital mutilation.
No Fallacy	>This is seriously an awful quote. It implies that because an idea hasn't been thought of before, it doesn't have validity.  How did you infer that from this quote?  He's clearly highlighting the way everyone draws their own random interpretation from the book as they see fit, just because it suits their own moral views...
No Fallacy	Please see the legal consideration of adoptive parents. 
No Fallacy	"To me, Christianity (and other religions) just seem like a gooey mixture of all human flaws and emotional desires, a perpetuation and ""justification"" of imperfection. The more successful a religion is, the more wrong it is."
No Fallacy	What a disgusting ritual.  So disrespectful to the animal.
No Fallacy	The reason is nostalgia. It is a reminder of the time when the sun never set on the British Empire and its glories.
No Fallacy	Our parents also thought it was ok to smoke during pregnancy to help with morning sickness.   I'm not saying watching TV is the same and yes I agree being familiar with technology is a must but doing something because our parents did is not always a good thing. 
No Fallacy	"""That's how we've always done it."" Seriously, doing something the same way for an age doesn't make it the correct way."
No Fallacy	"Certainly. Just like any other medical procedure it has its uses. But doing it for no reason other than ""that's what we've always done"" is moronic."
No Fallacy	I hate it so much. Another is: ''we have always done it that way.'' Yeah, but that doesn't mean your way was the right way of doing it. 
No Fallacy	Silly argument anyway. Is he saying you need a waiting period before granting people equal civil rights?
No Fallacy	That's the way we've always done it. 
No Fallacy	Cognitive dissonance and Confirmation bias
No Fallacy	"""Because it's *tradition*. Do you not *respect tradition*?!"""
No Fallacy	"""Because this is the way we've always done it.""   Not saying that tried and true practices are bad, but either entertain the suggestion that you could be doing a task differently and get the same results more efficiently, or tell me that you have tested every possible alternative, and that this is the most effective way of completing the task."
No Fallacy	"Lmao there's gross dudes on a thread about a 12 year old rape victim in Ireland being denied an abortion saying it's ok that she was forced to have the baby because *12 year old girls have been having babies all through history*. Gross and inaccurate.   Edit: I mean if your argument for forcing her to birth the baby is ""abortion is murder"", whatever I don't agree but I can see where you're coming from. HOWEVER ""but we used to do it that way!"" isn't a damn argument. We used to do a lot of things that caused us to die before 30, we don't have to anymore. "
No Fallacy	Because most communities use it for good. For example, sports communities for game threads and TV communities for episodes.
No Fallacy	Youd think to try and convince people that veganism is the right way, theyd stop making fun of non-vegans and start educating them instead. Oh well. 
No Fallacy	The fact that something has existed for centuries is not a strong argument in its defense.  Adultery has existed for millennia, but I will still argue that adultery is bad. 
No Fallacy	"The second one is frowned upon because it's pretty much asking to go back about 70 years, with the virgin bride housewife who looks after her man and all that goes with it. Women are naturally going to get annoyed because they fought hard to get away from being the ""little woman at home""."
No Fallacy	That filth pays for the services that this province provides you with. And I am sure you dont turn them down.
No Fallacy	"""Because that's how we've always done it.""  Companies that use this excuse are just asking for trouble."
No Fallacy	Because we went to the moon we have the ISS and the Hubble Space Telescope and the Space Shuttle and many smaller but just as important advances.  In theory we can send someone to Mars, maybe, sort of with a possibility they could get back.   The only way to get the knowledge is to do it.  And knowledge is what makes the world go around, humans survive and is what leads to the next step in human survival and evolution
No Fallacy	">Not much. You know what definitely does cause some people to commit acts of violence? Alcohol. Millions do so every year because of it. And yet i can still walk into any off-licence, bar, pub, club and buy enough to get me wasted.  As neat as that analogy might seem, it's not a very good one. Alcohol has [thousands of years](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_alcoholic_beverages) going for it.  If a new drug, equivalent to alcohol in terms of ""destructiveness"" (I'm sure someone can come up with a handful that might fit the bill) hit the streets in the last 40 years there's a good chance it would be thoroughly illegal by now."
No Fallacy	"Because Steve was not traditionally thought of as ""uncaused cause"" or ""unmoved mover."""
No Fallacy	"I hate that the Scalia and Roberts are dumb enough to argue, ""marriage has between bewteen a man and a woman for a millennium."" Yes, women were property, children were free labor, and people owned slaves for millennia, too. "
No Fallacy	well i think it's safe to say that living a lifestyle of our modern technological society is blasphemy.  god didn't start us out with nothing.  he gave us rudimentary agriculture, domesticated plants and animals, basic architecture, and not much else.  he could have created us without those, or he could have created us with modern medicine and internet, so it stands to reason that the technological level he started us with is his preferred level for us.  we're supposed to not understand germ theory, and understanding germ theory is against his plan.  if it was part of his plan he would have included it in his holy book.  
No Fallacy	You do realise that past events usually help predict future ones? If that wasn't so there would be no point to the brains ability to learn.
No Fallacy	I do not forbid someone to do it. Everyone has the right to. Just because life is completely meaningless, doesn't mean you should waste it. People have been doing a LOT of things for thousands of years, doesn't make it right.
No Fallacy	Ferals should always dodge cars, they did in the first game and it was one of the reasons they were so nightmarish - It was tricky to just run them down, so you had to risk getting out of the car.  First bit of good news I can actually remember reading..
No Fallacy	another main point I like to reiterate on is that literally ***NOBODY*** farms/bots easy clues this way, the thieve HAM members.
No Fallacy	"I find it funny when people of older generations use the phrase, ""Respect your elders."" More often than not, they resort to this phrase when the younger generations call these people out for whatever shortsightedness they commit. Ignorance and arrogance, hand in hand."
No Fallacy	If they can catch it in their own waters, then they can catch it to extinction, but when they have to enter another territory its a different story.
No Fallacy	Possibly because most of the world is still using 2.x.
No Fallacy	1.)  Because the state only covers certain things like child labor, safety, etc.  2.)  This is too stupid to answer but I'll bite.  You can love state-funded things like roads and not love state-funded things like torture.  One does not require the other.  This also doesn't classify itself as a riddle.  Bonghitta, you have a long way to go my friend.
No Fallacy	I don't see how this has anything to do with logic. Logic is about rules governing the derivation of conclusions from premises. I think you just mean that his argument is vacuous. And so it is.
No Fallacy	"One of the main arguments I've heard on keeping ""under god"" in the pledge of allegiance was because ""it's tradition."" No it Fucking isn't!"
No Fallacy	One of this guy's big arguments seems to be that cars are here so deal with it. I find this, combined with the second half of the split article, interesting and sort of ironic.  Alan Turing committed suicide after being chemically castrated because homosexuality *used to* be a crime. Somewhere along the lines, people came to their senses and things began to change. Along the same lines, people were once burned because of allegations of witchcraft. We don't do that anymore because it's ludicrous.  Simply saying 'this is the way it is' does not constitute an argument. It's entirely possible that 'the way it is' doesn't make a lot of sense and should be changed.
No Fallacy	I'm going to do this because I hate when conservatives do the opposite.  This isn't an argument. Just because people were wrong once doesn't mean they are wrong now. All it means is that there is a possibility they could be wrong this time.
No Fallacy	Any idea what the actual likelihood of rescheduling is?  I mean, do we have a record of this particular court's tendency to favor evidence over tradition?  This can be a real concern in some courts.
No Fallacy	"I *hate* the ""It's tradition"" argument. Who fucking cares? Just because it was ""good enough for your grandpappy"" doesn't mean that's how we should keep it. Shit, we'd all still be in the Dark Ages. "
No Fallacy	This has always been baffling to me as well. If I show somebody a book that claims 500 witnesses saw a friend of mine rise from the dead after three days and perform miracles last year, they'd tell me to fuck off. But if it's in a book from a couple thousand years ago, now it's totally reliable.
No Fallacy	As a supporter of the royals (i wouldn't go so far as royalist but still) i think any of them interfering in politics is wrong, so i am having a serious crisis of belief right now.
No Fallacy	Holy guacamole. I would NOPE the fuck out of there ASAP.   That is not normal. At all. At aaaaaalllllllllll.
No Fallacy	"I have also had an idea for a micro game based around criminal litigation. One side would be the prosecutor and the other would be a Defense Attorney.   There would be 3 phases to the game: Pre-Trial, Trial and Sentencing. The game could end at any point.    State and Defense draw their ""case strength"" at the beginning of the game to determine their starting points. This would also help guide where they thing the best spot for the game to end for their party would be. For example, a State's Attorney with a very weak case would do better by negotiating a plea deal. A defense attorney with a solid affirmative defense would probably want to take the case on trial or win with a pre-trial motion.   I go back and forth on mechanics, but playing cards to put influence cubes into a bag has always just made sense to me for this game.  "
No Fallacy	Sort of surprised I had to scroll this far down to find the bullshit-false-equivalency comment. 
No Fallacy	To be a fair, a mentally disturbed crossdressing teacher would be a pretty big distraction and could impact the students' ability to learn. 
No Fallacy	Just to supplement this advice...  Don't learn logical fallacies just so you can smugly throw around their names during discussions.  Learn them, so that you can logically deconstruct them when you're formulating your own counter-argument.
No Fallacy	"Regardless, it doesn't matter. Doing things ""just because that's how they've always been done"" is not justification. You can say the same about slavery. "
No Fallacy	"""The same reason you don't believe in Odin or Vishnu."""
No Fallacy	It's a bad excuse if it is currently being done badly.  It may be fine if the alternative is no better.  For example: why is the entrance on the north and the exit on the south?  Because it is and everyone is used to it can be a good enough reason not to change it.  (again, assuming that there is no/negligible benefit to reversing it)
No Fallacy	Lotta people saying things like this:  >it is just the way it is.  >You can stop saying YL but you're still going to see it all over the place.   Just because you think it can't stop doesn't mean it can't, or that it shouldn't.
No Fallacy	Why? 
No Fallacy	"Simple answer...no, it's not.   ""Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools"" Romans 1:22"
No Fallacy	This is not even a SyAAF strike.  And to point to the horrible civilian casualties - dead and maimed - that are the end result of any war and its shelling and bombing and use that as a way to question how one can support one side or the other is not productive. War, especially a total war with the highest stakes, is a question of end goals and only those who don't think it through in a comprehensive way are going to ditch the side best for their nation's interests because they employ brutal tactics. The other side also uses brutal tactics. With a lower death toll you say? Because they have less powerful weapons and would do the same with these. 
No Fallacy	Any records to fix here? Ohh. 
No Fallacy	But it's a whole lot more that gets them there. Dogs only have this opportunity because of the efforts of others during their injury woes.
No Fallacy	">well explained and logically sound statement   ""Oh c'mon, it's *tradition!*  "
No Fallacy	Child porn was protected speech until 1982.  Possession of child porn was protected by the constitution until 1990.  The slippery slope is going in the opposite direction you think it is.  
No Fallacy	How is this comparable to reseeding an entire conference just for the playoffs? Rivalries would be much less intense if this were the case, but the **biggest** reason to not do this is the insane travel time and planning.
No Fallacy	This is sure to be a controversial article.  I don't at all disagree with the author. Coming from Guild Wars 2 and Destiny, FFXIV's consistency is a *godsend* - it's one of my favourite things about this game. I love XIV as it is, and I can count on Square Enix to deliver more and more of the XIV that I love. Unlike with games like Guild Wars and Destiny, I'm not constantly terrified that the entire thing is going to be upended next year. It's a relief, and a big part of why XIV has been my main game for quite some time now.
No Fallacy	"My daughter was like that at 3.  My sister is a kindergarten teacher and she just loves telling people she taught my daughter multiplication as a toddler.  Really, she was distracting her in a store, and my daughter was counting by 2's.  My sister said ""can you do that with 3's?""  My daughter thought about it and then just did it.  My sis told her it was called multiplication and to this day takes credit for it.  My daughter is currently in 6th grade, taking both Algebra 1 and Geometry.  She isn't doing so well in history.  Probably because, for example, instead of taking notes on the Haitian Revolution yesterday, she started writing all the exponents for 3.  She was proud to show me she got all the way to 3 to the 50th... some people just ""feel"" numbers and enjoy them more than other things."
No Fallacy	>Let me begin by saying that voluntaryism in my assessment is just a new word for anarchism being used by pro-capitalist, right-wing libertarians who got tired of defending their views on the wage system and absentee land ownership from criticism by actual anarchists. And yes, I have a right to say actual anarchists. Anarchists are historically and ideologically anti-capitalist.  Anarchism is the belief in the creation of human societies where all individuals are free to reach their greatest possible potential absent coercion, not a clean slate where individuals can position themselves above others in society and use that position to extract wealth from their labor.  So.. Appeal to tradition and appeal to authority to support a postulate? I give up reading the rest when the intro lacks fundamental understanding of rhetoric.
No Fallacy	"What if the Dad answered with ""tradition""?"
No Fallacy	That's the way we have always done things... When people say this at work, I want to hurt them... badly.
No Fallacy	"God... ""journalism"" in this country...  > Federal parliament has been reciting prayers at the start of each sitting day since 1901  [WRONG!](http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Senate/Powers_practice_n_procedures/~/link.aspx?_id=8C004ED71E9D44FEACE193716D2F3FD6&_z=z)  That's 1903 for those playing at home, introduced after vociferous campaigning from the precursors of today's ACL.  It was opposed by the then ALP leader Gregor McGregor as ""a distasteful and hypocritical parade of religion"".  "
No Fallacy	whats the point here? Animals each other animals...
No Fallacy	"How does ""it's been in place a long time"" == it must be a good policy? Slavery was around for a long time too. Not that I'm equating the two, only the argument."
No Fallacy	"""Because we've always done it this way! """
No Fallacy	How are the liberals the immature ones in this situation?  Trump's the one boycotting a tradition because he's a afraid people will make fun of him.
No Fallacy	lmao when Ham Sarris applies this logic to muslims being turned into terrorists by drone strikes but not to conservatives going full nazi bc they're being silenced by sjw's  
No Fallacy	I don't generally like to blatantly point out logical fallacies, but this is a false dichotomy.
No Fallacy	Yeah, punching jagoff incels who are demanding a racist police state to stop the secret jewish conspiracy to keep them from getting laid, so statist. Hiking is peak statism. Fuck off nazi, half of y'all are weaker and less numerous than the feeblest corners of the radical left. You will lose.
No Fallacy	You may want to investigate the environmental track record of any non-capitalist economic system.
No Fallacy	WWI.  Atomic bombs.  Never change guys 
No Fallacy	This is absolutely hilarious to me. I've seen a lot of criticism of the Gillette ad about it being hypocritical, but never actually someone complaining about the message it's conveying.   It's literally just about being a respectful, considerate human being. And *that's* what he's upset and offended about?   Jesus Christ these people...
No Fallacy	Thats because Jeff dedicated his life to eating the absolute best and working every single to working out and working out intelligently. If Im not mistaken he has a phd in fitness 
No Fallacy	There really just needs to be an amendment at some point, because the current situation is untenable and virtually no one on any side of the aisle feels that we should have literally no restrictions on gun ownership.
No Fallacy	I don't remember the parkland high school students suing the right wing media for their vicious attacks on people that were shot at.  Double standard. 
No Fallacy	How so? 
No Fallacy	Who believes in 2 gods? Sounds like an excuse for an atheist to pass off the arguement
No Fallacy	I Believe in the death penalty for anyone who has sexaul assaulted a child. That being said though the ones who deserve death deserve to feel what they have caused. I believe they should endure the same thing they have created and at that moment of realization death should come upon  them.
No Fallacy	You know say you want more people of color in a country is not the same as saying you wont less white people

No Fallacy	Is Will saying that Native American genocide was necessary for America to grow?
No Fallacy	In the meantime, we have all of the EU and Canada dumping on Trump 24/7 and it's OK.

No Fallacy	"This thread is full of people who blame FB for their problems and look for ways to demonize it.  ""But muh data""  if you cared about your data you wouldn't be browsing reddit or own a cell phone or have any smart devices.    People need to stop picking and choosing their battles based on the flavor of the month outrage."
No Fallacy	"My favorite part:  ""How hard is it (for Trump) to say that Nazis are bad people?""  Hmm. I don't know. About as hard as it was for you to ever say ""Islamic terrorist""?"
No Fallacy	If you enjoy the game without it, play the game. If you don't, don't play it. If something is not announced, we won't know if it will come or not.   If the future brings an exploration system, you can return then and play - assuming you even like their take on an exploration system.   If it doesn't, you do something else.   Make it not about speculation, optimistic, realistic, pessimistic. Make it about pragmatism. You like the game, you play it, you don't like the game, you don't play it.
No Fallacy	Basically anything in act against God...is taking sides with Satan. So even simple things like having a birthday for a 1 year old is sliding with Satan
No Fallacy	Lenovo doesn't care about enthusiasts or fans, nor should they. The ThinkPad market is a corporate market, by and large, and that market does not upgrade their machines. It increasingly rare to service corporate machines in house, it's faster/cheaper to replace the whole machine and reimage. So serviceability is less and less important.   It's unfortunate for the people that like the old ThinkPad virtues are being less well served by the newer machines but those people are not a significant part of the market 
No Fallacy	What good work is she doing. If she was using the ''spotlight'' she's getting to promote people like him, doing actual work for the planet, she would be doing good work. Instead she's using her popularity to say what people are whispering in her ears or taking uneducated guesses about what's happening.
No Fallacy	"Whenever I see comments with the words ""emotional intelligence"" and ""nuance"" ,I immediately understand I'm dealing with an idiot."
No Fallacy	Just pondering, would you advocate totally open borders? And if so, would this be reciprocal, e.g. I could buy land freely in Central America?  
No Fallacy	Its almost like they *dont* want to admit that they wish poor people would just die. Oh well, mental gymnastics 10/10.
No Fallacy	Is this comment section real? Wtf is going on here lol
No Fallacy	false dichotomy
No Fallacy	More like Wahhabist mosques funded by Saudi-Arabia radicalising youths, oh wait that's exactly what happens, but when the alt-right use people like PewDiePie as a vehicle to normalize Nazism, then its completely innocent.
No Fallacy	we laugh at jokes, we don't laugh at discrimination
No Fallacy	AOC is doing wonders for Trump.
No Fallacy	Also, a good indication that moron isn't really a Christian.
No Fallacy	\&gt; Sorry, but I think it is ridiculous to give any pet chemotherapy. There are humans who don't have basic medical treatment.   &amp;#x200B;  I'm sorry, but that's a ridiculous and completely irrelevant comparison. There are humans who don't have food and shelter either, so should we stop providing that for our pets as well?
No Fallacy	&gt; and to promote the rights of women by prohibiting misogynist religious garb.   This argument never made sense to me. It seems he's trying to espouse feminism while promoting an idea that takes the choice in the matter out of the hands of women, and lets the government decide for them.
No Fallacy	Not quite, this is more specific to argumentation
No Fallacy	Cant admit they like some one because they are good looking..  oh I have admitted before that I had an ex where I ignored all the red flags and warnings from friends because she was incredibly good looking.  And surprise!  It was a train wreck because turns our *just being attractive* isnt all there is in life.   But the idea that Ill never be a Chad: so its over blackpill nonsense is just stupid.
No Fallacy	"&gt;Rian presents a false dichotomy here- as if to say there's only one type of ""true"" mythic hero.  That sounds like textbook gaslighting."
No Fallacy	The fact that they are not mutually exclusive is baffling.
No Fallacy	"The sheer lack of imagination of these people.   &gt; There are two paths of life : ""parenting and reshpunshibilityyy"" or ""alcohol and parttayyy"". If you forego the first path, it's only cause you want to get shitfaced every week-end.  It's not because YOUR life suddenly jumped from clubbing to diaper changing overnight that it means that it is the life of everybody around you.   There is so much more to life than binge drinking and being a smug parent. "

No Fallacy	Well, I always said electing Trump would bring about the worst period in our history.    THAT was right.
No Fallacy	This is the one of the arguments problems either cEDH is its own format and flash is format warping or cEDH is in fact part of  EDH and it was not format warping at all. Casual metas never saw Flash. It was not warping the format it was warping the fun of people that played the most cutthroat decks.
No Fallacy	"So that's it? The only two outcomes. It couldn't possibly be anything else. There's probably a debate term describing this awful argument but I don't know it. ""You either believe what I believe, or you believe in this crazy thing!"" Don't think about any other complex reasons for this, it has to be this basic."
No Fallacy	&gt; it's a reactionary response  And being forcefully CoC-ed is revolutionary?

No Fallacy	I mean that stuff Saudi has been doing for decades and the world gave them a pass.  Here is something a lot may not get, the killing of this journalist, for Saudi standards is middle of the pack bad.   Every leader gave them a pass for much worse things even few years ago.  Obama, Trump, every EU, Canadian leader all gave Saudi a pass.  I mean we all basically know part of the Saudi government helped fund 9/11. That came out under Obama.  What did he do?  Bomb Yeman becuase Saudi asked him too.   Trump is doing what every Us Leader is doing.
No Fallacy	don't praise them for this, they shouldn't be putting intrusive DRM in their stuff anyway
No Fallacy	&gt;Maybe not to release. But sooner or later Activision will have an influence and the first mounts will be available in the Shop.   Then quit? Wow, that was hard.
No Fallacy	Yeah, except this is true: all US presidents are murderers. Obama still killed brown children in the Middle East. 
No Fallacy	GRRM is making me ask this question due to lack of evidence in his vast tomes. Yes there is the point that those that died are usually not worth talking about, but in Fire &amp; Blood it seems that half the Night's Watch are castrated rapists from King's Landing. A throwaway line of 'he bled out/died from infection' or 'maesters have amazing potions/techniques to keep survival rates high' would have solved this issue, or even GRRM saying 'magic lol', but no they all live and have to find their way in an unkind world that just got another meaner. But I'm not sure my assumption is unreasonable
No Fallacy	"D&amp;D by Samuel Beckett would be him describing the opening tavern scene to the party and then forcing the players to sit in total silence at the table with each other for four hours. He would repeat this exact same session over and over until every player stopped showing up, at which point he would call it a ""successful campaign"".  His former players would protest that it was a complete disaster, to which Beckett would reply ""that is exactly what made it a great campaign.""     Min-maxer vs Roleplayer is a false dichotomy, though.     ^(And Samuel Beckett was a nobel-prize winning playwright. He had a master's understanding of narrative progression, pacing, tone, and a nearly obsessive attention to detail, he would actually be a pretty good, if) *^(highly)* ^(unconventional DM.)"
No Fallacy	And if your child is raped and gets pregnant, would you force them to give birth and be a parent?
No Fallacy	Love to see people thinking about this. Change happens when you have thought it out all the way through. The more you think the less that makes sense about this whole meat eating thing.
No Fallacy	Being all or nothing. Not understanding that an issue can have many problem, many solutions and many facets.   Not everything is black vs white or win vs lose. To not see shades of gray is a lack of abstract thinking.   And wow I feel like a judgemental douche for saying that.
No Fallacy	"Why are you assuming that the only options are modern capitalism and "" Hunting and foraging for every meal, shelter, fighting wildlife and the elements to survive?"" There are many more ways to organize society than this, and it ignores plenty of valid criticisms of capitalism."
No Fallacy	How dare someone want to get paid for their work.
No Fallacy	If you can take a critical thinking class, that would be a good way to go about it. If you cant do that right now, read up on the various logical fallacies such as straw man, red herring, slippery slope, etc. Then notice situations in which your previous church, or people you knew, or people on TV, or even you yourself use one of these arguments. The more you notice, the easier it will become to discern facts from interpretations.
No Fallacy	Per *Legion*, wouldn't aiding the Emperor undermine the Cabal's plan to make Horus win?
No Fallacy	&gt; that fucked around with weed Such an ignorant view to think that weed leads to overdoses. Alcohol   is a MUCH more powerful drug and deadly drug. Please do research before you blame ODs on a benign plant proven time and time again to have medical benefits. 
No Fallacy	We don't need to pretend Republicans would realistically investigate republicans anymore than democrats would realistically investigate democrats.  Both old parties are corrupt, and don't truly mind abuses of power...so long as those abuses benefit their particular party.
No Fallacy	&gt; We should just let people walk across our border?  Yeah, because our only two options are to either commit atrocities or have zero controls at all. What a fuckin psycho.
No Fallacy	so should we kill our seniors citizens who need help or disability people  
No Fallacy	Still wont protect you from axial compression injury. Wont protect you from a coup counter coup injury of the brain either. Bio mechanical physics will not be changed. 
No Fallacy	But Sam has perfect reason.  It's perfect according to him so it is us who must be wrong lol.
No Fallacy	&gt;To deny universal salvation you must either reject that God loves all, he desire all to be saved or that he is all powerful.   That is known as a False Dichotomy Fallacy (aka: A Black and White Fallacy)
No Fallacy	Yes lets believe Iran instead?
No Fallacy	Hey thats awesome! Unfortunately it doesnt go very far in proving the existence of the supernatural, but if being part of a spiritual social club does you well, then everybody wins, more or less.
No Fallacy	&gt;We really need to start taking a hard look at what we're doing. The world is turning into a living organism. If we don't change, if we continue to use the tools we have at our disposal, we will continue to be a part of the problem.  He doesn't understand modern technology.
No Fallacy	No problem. Youre on your own. No tax money, no military, no food. Go take care of yourselves.
No Fallacy	I hate the people who think that if they just cite the names of logical fallacies in place of an argument.
No Fallacy	paranoia?
No Fallacy	Science denial is hardly the prerogative of one party. The Democrats are just as anti-science as the Republicans when it comes to modern nuclear power systems, genetically modified organisms, fluoridation, vaccination, and a litany of other subjects in engineering and science.
No Fallacy	The anti-America crowd in this country will manufacture a reason to attack every word that comes out of this convention whether they have a reason to or not.    Trump is standing up for his country and they don't like that.     Meanwhile both Hillary Clinton and her husband lied under oath: once in front of a federal judge and once in front of Congress.  Yes, a presidential candidate **lied to Congress while under oath.**  One can only guess at the unholy nightmare that will emerge from the White House if she is elected.   
No Fallacy	>I did not want to be a nazi, they arebad, I learned all my life. And they still are, this scared me. I felt like a insanely cruel person.  The problem in a nutshell. Of course nazis are bad, but criticizing immigration policies don't make you one
No Fallacy	He's just not yelling and cutting people off. The content of his points are about on par with a 9th grade book report. 
No Fallacy	"Thank you :]  I think the general trend is ""atheist"" = ""liberal"" when that's not the case (nor should it be)."
No Fallacy	"Ya know, I'm coming on in the middle of this, and have no idea who either of these people are, but the Content Cop dude seems funny and reasonable.  But he's wrong about ""it's either all ok, or all not ok"". False dichotomy. That being said, I agree that the N word has been given far too much weight and significance. Racism cannot be reduced to whether or not someone uses the N word."
No Fallacy	Both? Both is good  Yea I'm not sure I like that one is supposed to rule the other out.
No Fallacy	"It was shrewd indeed. What gets me is he even said ""Even if the key WAS planted...."" in his closing statement which I thought was a terrible move. Surprised that the jury didn't piece together that if one piece of eveidence was planted that it ALL could have been.  Perhaps Strang should have said ""If you are willing to believe that one piece of evidence was planted, then you must believe it ALL was."" "
No Fallacy	Why would you go to another country to tell people not to come to yours? If you feel that way what are you doing going there?
No Fallacy	Why does our state have to have this abortion law anyway? I think abortion should be legal but it's unethical to require health insurance to pay for it.   Even California, the capital of liberalism, doesn't have a law like that. We should be helping people to prevent the need for abortion. 
No Fallacy	> Mummy I wasn't sure whether to put the lego up my willy or up my bum. So I put it in my bum but now I've lost it.  Why did he have to do either?
No Fallacy	why are those the only two choices?
No Fallacy	Note that I was making the exact same arguments last night in the other thread about Romney's tweet. This isn't spin- it's a logical conclusion.
No Fallacy	The main part that I take issue with:  > When it comes to the origin of life on this earth, there are only two possibilities: creation or spontaneous generation. There is no third way. Spontaneous generation was disproved 100 years ago  Horrible. Just horrible.  Tries to make a point, and fails miserably.  * Spontaneous generation isn't abiogenesis. They are incredibly different.  * Spontaneous generation = maggots form from rotten meat  * Abiogenesis = Self-replicating RNA could have been LUCA's prior ancestor  How was spontaneous generation disproven 100 years ago? Here it is: Pasteur concealed a glass of jar with food (but sterile) in it and maggots did not form. Poof. Lastly it should be on the OP to make me understand how this jar experiment disproved the modern RNA hypothesis.  
No Fallacy	"That's a false dichotomy. You could change the plan once or twice -- it doesn't have to be ""ever-changing"".  Also, a well executed bad plan that results in a bad outcome might be worse than no plan at all. Imagine you have a plan to repair some potholes in the road. The plan is so bad that it ties up traffic for months and in the end the potholes are still largely present. You would have been better off just living with them."
No Fallacy	"Let's remember also that *it is a crime to lie to federal law enforcement.*  (See Michael Flynn, George Papadapapapolis, Carter Page, etc.)    If Dr. Ford *is* lying, then Republicans should be *eager* to get her in front of an FBI interrogator.      Can you imagine what kind of huge political win that would be for Republicans?      &gt;""Breaking News: 'Me too' Democrat lies to FBI and is facing jail time just weeks before the midterm elections, vindicating Justice Kavanaugh and President Trump in the process.  And after that, is political correctness killing your dog?  We scream, you decide."""
No Fallacy	I'm not making that claim, and neither is Ben Jealous.    This post is focused on the claims from the Hogan campaign that Larry Hogan is some type of centrist.
No Fallacy	The BBC prides itself on it's journalistic impartiality. The fact that you both think it's biased means it's doing the job right.
No Fallacy	A threat to the military industrial complex perhaps.   Watching the left go full war hawk and push MIC has been really interesting. Just goes to show you folks are all party before standards. 
No Fallacy	Agreed but we can all agree that's a false dichotomy on both sides right?
No Fallacy	&gt; What power would a wife have  Is that the **why**?  &gt; Why would any woman accept such a dynamic?  So her husband is fully committed and invested in the marriage ... instead of just being there but checked out.  &gt; In addition, insecurity and jealously are perfectly normal human emotions for that woman to have.  So is the desire to have sex.  So, how do we reconcile the two?  &gt; Why should she even attempt to overcome such natural human emotions instead of desiring and obtaining monogamy?  Again, so shes not in a phantom relationship with a husband thats mentally, emotionally and financially checked out of the marriage.  &gt; What does she have to gain by doing so?  A husband who is fully committed to, happy, satisfied with, and investing his time, energy, and self to ... his wife ... as opposed to one who is a domestic prisoner ... simply there, but checked out.
No Fallacy	Only same faith marriage is actually accepted in israel. This country is fucked up, they just want to seem progressive by doing some pink washing  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marriage_in_Israel
No Fallacy	Honestly, this.   A loot vacuum would destroy this game, straight up.   And on death effects? Their point is extremely solid, but people are too butthurt around all this to actually consider it. They're completely correct. We instant delete maps so it's the only way for them to fight back. FFS, we already saw what happened when they buffed boss health and added phase damage mitigation to slow down builds -- the community fucking exploded with rage. Absolutely hypocritical. You cant have your cake and eat it too.
No Fallacy	No one has ever exploited communism in the history of the world
No Fallacy	This crisis would've thrown even the most efficient communist economy into recession as well.  Edit: as well
No Fallacy	Is it immoral to wear sneakers made by people in sweatshops?
No Fallacy	"The whole ""I'll always be hurting someone in some way so I might as well do nothing"" is bullshit.   You're basically saying you don't feel like you should try at all because you are always going to be a part of suffering one way or another.  Which means your actions are going to contribute towards more suffering - ie the eating of animal products instead of less.  You're tipping the scales back the other way.     Veganism is about doing the least amount of harm that you can.  No one is going to be perfect, but if enough of use try, things are going to slowly get less shitty for all."
No Fallacy	We dont care which is more damaging. We care that one is consider a gross violation of human rights and is outlawed in most if the world while the other is actively encouraged and in the US is covered by medical insurance. 
No Fallacy	I feel that. I just think it's funny that Christian's and the like use it as an argument when no one watchmaker actually makes all the parts in a watch. 
No Fallacy	Good job Trump voters. 
No Fallacy	You aren't with it, you are against it.   i.e. : If you don't support Donald Trump you love Hillary.
No Fallacy	Can anyone enforce against different systems existing light years away? If not, it's irrelevant whether one group approves of the other's existence or not. 
No Fallacy	Also note that raising animals, beef especially, is much, much more land and energy intensive than growing food or cash crops.   This is what aboutism at its finest. 
No Fallacy	"That's just an unwitting variation on Pascal's wager.  The very question presupposes or assumes that there is reason to consider the  LDS church to be true.  I think an underlying mechanism of ""falling away"" from the church is that our own assumptions collapse. We no longer, well, *assume* them.  The fault in Pascal's wager is that it's a false dichotomy. It's between just two assumptions; the specific sect in question...or not.  But when your assumption that one sect stands out collapses, you have to consider *any* sect. When you see your sect as just one among many, and no reason why *it's* true versus others, Pascal's Wager collapses because it doesn't include a provision for selecting the right sect. Most Mormons have never seriously considered another religion being true, and they hold specific prejudices about why some aren't true (Catholics, Protestants).  The same question applies to them."
No Fallacy	I used to look up to Dr. Paul. I have little to no respect left. 
No Fallacy	Oh so there is no left -right distinction in Romania?  Thanks for your help
No Fallacy	&gt; people of non-abrahamic religious traditions would contest your dichotomy  What do you mean by non-abrahamic religious traditions?  What is with all of you guys saying its what you say a false dichotomy??  Care to explain?   If you doubt the way I'm describing it, then by default you assume all came to be by pure chance.   Go ahead, give me a rebuttal on this.  &gt; that's not a better question.  How is it not. Even if you don't believe some possibilities, you should still consider them.  
No Fallacy	Y'all need Pascals dilema
No Fallacy	It's called the illusion of freewill.
No Fallacy	Lol. Nicole Arbour is such a joke. [she did a re-make of This is America by Childish Gambino](https://youtu.be/XZugREAmYc4) , and in it she talks about how women are objectified and judged by the way they look, and forced to look a certain way to meet societys standards. Pretty ironic considering how much she talks shit about fat people.
No Fallacy	Picture is not made for fun. It was made to make you think. The easiest way to deal with this picture is to deny the truth of it like you did by saying you don't fall into any category.
No Fallacy	&gt; First off, most people dont really care THAT much about politics. But this applies to EVERYONE AROUND THE WORLD, not just Singaporeans. This anger Ive read on this sub recently directed specifically at Singaporeans is mind boggling because its not like everyone else around the world is politically enlightened. In the US only 60% of the electorate voted in the 2016 presidential elections.  False equivalency. In the US people don't vote for various reasons, due to redlining, voter disenfranchisement, and the darn simple fact that election days are not holiday unlike here. On the other hand, it's somewhat an offense to not vote her, as your name gets struck off the registry and you'll have to pay a 50 dollars fine if you don't have a valid reason.    Not all democracies are enlightened, but if the civil movements and waves of resistance movements in NA and EU are a yardstick of anything, it'll be the opposite of political apathy, at least generationally.  &gt; Furthermore, a lot of people are one-issue voters, which isnt an informed way to make voting decisions either.  Why not? People vote on the platform that pushes their hot-issue buttons the most. Short-sighted as this may be, you yourself mentioned that we have a limited attention span and resources to read and digest manifestos, study the track record of politicians, or catch up on debates and town halls. Humans rely on heuristics when a quick judgement has to be made against resource constraints. Or, humans are lazy, so there is absolutely nothing wrong with voting along a single or several issues for elections. Advanced democracies do this. Brexit was predicated on a lie about NHS financing. Trump won because he painted his opponent to be more untrustworthy as him. In a perfect world, both wouldn't have happened, and I don't think anyone will deny that UK and the US are developed democracies.  &gt; Second, Id say a lot of people need to read up on history more. The older generation wouldnt be as outraged by this because the govt has ALWAYS been like. This tacit social contract between Singaporeans and govt has been in place since before a lot of people on this sub were born.  So what do you get by appealing to tradition? Just because we were in legit danger as a young country circa the Malayan Conspiracy times it means that we must uphold the same social contract our grandparents signed with the powers that be? We can't demand our government to a higher standard of accountability and transparency? We should be thankful that they don't jail all keyboard warriors under ISA 2.0 for 10 years for spreading fake news about TPTB because that's what they did to our forefathers during Coldstore?   &gt; Third, if youre vehemently against something, then please simultaneously think of the alternative solution youd prefer. I see far too many people complain about specific policies (not specifically fake news law) without giving their own better alternative.  Fallacy of false dichotomy/burden of proof. A diner doesn't have to cook better than their chef to be a critic. The electorate shouldn't bear the burden of proof of coming up with alternatives to show that a policy sucks. There's a reason why the Government is supported by research institutes, think-tanks, polling agency and data analytics experts to formulate policies. Asking the layman to come up with a proper alternative or shut up, especially if that retort comes from TPTB, is an indictment against our paternalistic and top-down approach to democracy, that we are serving our MPs and Ministers instead of the other way round.  Still giving you an upvote, because end of the day what we need is this: proper fucking discourse. Not the phony electorate outreach program REACH they use to create phony and dodgy figures whenever they need polling numbers to support a controversial policy, but actual discourse amongst the electorate to be educated and politically aware if not motivated.
No Fallacy	You determine a temperature by taking it. You determine a height by measuring it. You determine sexual compatibility by having sex. Growing up in purity culture teachings, I was taught that sexual compatibility was universal. All men are compatible with all women. But looking around, it didn't seem that way. Some men were only attracted to certain women and vice versa. That was just attraction! Christians surely would never open up about sex, but would on their anoymous blogs. That's where I read the account of a lady and her husband who wrote down what they liked about sex and swapped lists - they were complete opposites! No wonder neither of them were satisfied with their sex lives! So Christians make sexually incompatible marriages work because many don't believe in divorce, but it isn't exactly a walk in the park. Since premarital sex is viewed as sin and everyone knows it, you have to decide which guns you'll stick to. A belief in no sex before marriage or a belief in sexual compatibility in long term relationships.
No Fallacy	So doctors had nothing to do with it?
No Fallacy	"""find a method to stop preventable murder. ""  OK.  Found one-  Eliminate gun control laws to allow citizens to defend themselves and discourage violent crime.  My support for this?  Lott's book, as I have repeatedly cited.  And I am not asking you to show me ""more"" facts supporting gun control.  I am asking you to show me SOME.  Show me some and we can weight the arguments.  So far your argument weighs nothing.  And comparing me to a creationist?  Really?  I have research on my side.  So far you have nothing whatsoever.  Who is relying entirely on their 'faith' here?  It isn't me....  So, show me your capacity for reason.   Cite SOME research supporting your contention that gun control laws will make the public safer.  Put up or shut up.   "
No Fallacy	How many police are there in the USA? Something more than a million? So the shooting rate for police was 40 per million last year? And the rate for blacks was 7 per million and whites 3 per million?  Surely those numbers can't be right? 
No Fallacy	People can worry about both. There isn't a limit on worry.

No Fallacy	The Snowden documents show that Apple and all the other major tech companies joined Prism. They share all your information with the government without warrants. They don't actually care about your privacy, but they want their customers to think they do. The public outcry from Apple is a smoke screen and a sales publicity stunt.

No Fallacy	"A lot of choices aren't mutually exclusive. People tend to think ""It's either X or Y"" when most of the time that's not the case. It could be both. It could even be neither. There can be ways to achieve both goals, or there might be a different way that doesn't achieve either one, but is a more satisfying solution. If people get out of the mindset of X or Y, and learn to compromise, there will be a lot more solutions and opportunities available."
No Fallacy	I hate how everybody implies Glaurung (and sometimes Justing) is carrying his team. I mean buds YoDa and Prism also played very well, you don't perform well as a team in HotS if anyone is sloppy
No Fallacy	Maybe I'm drunk as shit and sitting in an airport pub in the English Styx or maybe it's something inherent in that comic (let's just say both), but this was, in my opinion, the best Existential Comics comic I have read *in forever-time*. I rate it webcomic/webcomic.
No Fallacy	Yes, it's a bit upsetting to see one side being treated better than the other.  Some DS focused players I know have actually decided to quit the game. They've been waiting for the new content and now it turned out they won't be able to actively play it, just passively drop their units to claim a territory.

No Fallacy	False dichotomy from a pedantic fellator of his own nonsense.
No Fallacy	Ive never understood that argument. How are you going to review movies if youve never made one? How are you going to comment on what our government is doing if youve never held an office? 
No Fallacy	I just find it interesting that this continues to garner so much attention and speculation on reddit when there is literally an on-going genocide in Myanmar against a population of defenseless people where countless people are being murdered in cold blood or watching their children be killed in front of them.

No Fallacy	"&gt;I've seen a lot of convincing arguments against it, but I still think it's a valid perception for my own personal faith.    What about ""your personal faith"" makes Pascal's Wager valid, when it's clearly not? How logic works does not alter based on your personal beliefs.    &gt;Anyone think they can reason with me on why it's total bogus?   Because it is based on a false dichotomy of ""either this one, specific god is real or *no* god is real"". That is a dichotomy that is not justified."
No Fallacy	Yes, it's called false dichotomy. Another way to say it is claiming A must be the best option because it's better than B.
No Fallacy	Well this is some very stupid logic. Why not talk about both?
No Fallacy	And also an appeal to the obvious as in: do you not see that the grass is green? Therefore, god is real.  &gt;**Glorify the name of thy Guardian-Lord Most High, Who hath created**, and further, given order and proportion; Who hath ordained laws.

No Fallacy	If you are bored and disgusted by politics and don't bother to vote, you are in effect voting for the entrenched Establishments of the two major parties, who please rest assured are not dumb, and who are keenly aware that it is in their interests to keep you disgusted and bored and cynical and to give you every possible reason to stay at home doing one-hitters and watching MTV on primary day. By all means stay home if you want, but don't bullshit yourself that you're not voting. **In reality, there is no such thing as not voting:** you either vote by voting, or you vote by staying home and tacitly doubling the value of some Diehard's vote.  -David Foster Wallace

No Fallacy	Regulations aren't the problem, regulatory capture is. I wish there were a politician in my locale running on that. It becomes an unnecessary dichotomy of regulations vs no regulations rather than a nuanced discussion of individual cases, some which protect consumers and the public, and others which are anti-competitive, designed by the leaders of a given industry.

No Fallacy	A legacy huh?  Tell your teach to name all of George Washingtons cilldren. She can't. Because people don't remember you because of your children.

No Fallacy	"I find it interesting that Trump, despite having far worse allegations against him than Kavanaugh, seems to be immune to Curses via simply ignoring them and changing the subject.  Do you think Kavanaugh could have avoided this Curse by refraining from either admitting to or denying it?  If he were, for example, to say something like ""I am against acts of sexual assault in general but because of the vague nature of the accusation I can't respond directly to it.""?"
No Fallacy	There's a song called Like a Kennedy by Joywave.

It's a great song, but damn, that we are **here** now.  I know we've made a lot of mistakes in this country, but in my 40s now, I never, ever thought we'd have sunk this low, where lyrics in a song about shooting immigrants are not only relevant, but something likely said by the fucking president.

No Fallacy	"The important part was ""as a whole"".  As in, the entire gender, without exception.  Since the person I was arguing against was attempting to speak for her entire gender, I felt it necessary to show how ridiculous that was through exaggeration.  Being afraid of confrontation is something that a lot of people deal with, men and women alike.  I think insisting that women just can't deal with a handful of assholes would make me feel a little peeved if I were a woman."
No Fallacy	It'll depend on the actual argument, but this sounds like a [false dichotomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_dilemma):  * Door 1 led to something bad * Door 2 would have led to something better  They are dismissing other possibilities:   * Door 2 might have led to an even worse outcome than door 1 * Door 2 might have led to an equally bad outcome as door 1  
No Fallacy	So what do you propose for all the dudes like me then, huh?  I'm not about to pick a fight with my dad for his decision and I'm not about to start feeling sorry for myself when I had no reason to before.

No Fallacy	I was gonna rag on who ever made that comment until I realized the original post was fucking novel length
No Fallacy	"&gt; To those who argue well x job pays y amount do you think that maybe they should get a significant wage hike to so they dont live in poverty either?  For real, I don't understand why this is so hard for people.  But every time I bring this point up, GOP_Fanboy just reverts to ""lol who are you to decide who gets paid what communist etc"""
No Fallacy	"Isn't there a term for this type of argument? I forget what it is, but it brings out the worst in me. I can't fathom trying to be an adult in this society when you subscribe to the ""all effort is fascism! NEVER TRY!"" mentality.  Anywho, I don't believe for a single second this person is interested in any kind of movement, be it ""joyful"" or otherwise, but they'd change their tune if they could see how much easier it is to move when their body isn't structurally unsound and things only move when you mean them to."
No Fallacy	Very true, asked my friend what he thought about my art and just called it shit, I try to criticize his art he gets pissed
No Fallacy	"""There are two ways to see **[incredibly simplified issue]**, my way and the wrong way"""
No Fallacy	"> Theres no question that this has been a white middle-class feminism""  So you replace it with a Davos-class feminism. Got it."
No Fallacy	This is such an idiotic statement.  If people want something they will expend the energy they deem necessary to ensure they'll get it.   This isn't socialism, it's a contest.
