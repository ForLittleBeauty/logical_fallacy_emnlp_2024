Evading Burden of Proof	But there’s reason to think Thwaites and Pine Island could go even faster than Jakobshavn.
Evading Burden of Proof	paints a far more dire picture of the immediate consequences of climate change than previously thought
Evading Burden of Proof	The human contribution can be up to 30 percent or so of the total rainfall coming out of the storm
Evading Burden of Proof	while it’s true that studies in some regions show polar bears are lighter in weight than they were in the 1980s, there is no evidence that more individuals are starving to death or becoming too thin to reproduce because of less summer ice.
Evading Burden of Proof	Falsified and sure-to-be-falsified exaggerations from a parade of Ph.D. scientists
Evading Burden of Proof	When someone says, ‘climate science is settled,’ remind them to check the facts.
Evading Burden of Proof	Before the end of this century, 80% of the world’s population would be wiped out.
Evading Burden of Proof	Sadly, these supposed experts use mathematical equations that do not jibe with reality over the past 140 years.
Cherry Picking	The study is the product of a large group of Antarctic experts who collectively reviewed 24 recent measurements of Antarctic ice loss, reconciling their differences to produce the most definitive figures yet on changes in Antarctica.
Cherry Picking	there are alarming stories every day, like last month’s satellite data showing the globe warming, since 1998, more than twice as fast as scientists had thought
Cherry Picking	The report confidently claims that when temperatures rise, the reduction in premature deaths from cold are expected to be smaller than the increase in deaths from heat in the United States. Six footnotes are attached to that statement.
Cherry Picking	In recent decades this warming has been accompanied by a constant rise in the sea level and, it would appear, by an increase of extreme weather events, even if a scientifically determinable cause cannot be assigned to each particular phenomenon.
Cherry Picking	According to a recent National Economic Research Associates Economic Consulting study, the Paris Agreement could obliterate $3 trillion of GDP, 6.5 million industrial sector jobs and $7,000 in per capita household income from the American economy by 2040. Meeting the 2025 emissions reduction target alone could subtract $250 billion from our GDP and eliminate 2.7 million jobs. The cement, iron and steel, and petroleum refining industries could see their production cut by 21% 19%, and 11% respectively.
Cherry Picking	In pushing too hard for the case that global warming is universally bad for everything, the administration’s report undermines the reasonable case for climate action.
Cherry Picking	But the heads of small island nations, fearful of rising sea levels, had also asked scientists to examine the effects of 2.7 degrees of warming.
Cherry Picking	The extreme cycles of dry and wet weather appear to have been intensifying over the last three decades.
Cherry Picking	Huge sections of the Great Barrier Reef, stretching across hundreds of miles of its most pristine northern sector, were recently found to be dead, killed last year by overheated seawater.
Cherry Picking	Another consequence of the fast melting Arctic raises the possibility that there may be even worse extreme weather to come, according to a few scientists: titanic Atlantic superstorms and hurricanes barreling across Europe.
Cherry Picking	[South Australia] has the most expensive electricity in the world.
Cherry Picking	The ‘hockey stick’ graph [Figure] 
Cherry Picking	To revisit the ocean’s paleotemperatures now, we need to carefully quantify this re-equilibration, which has been overlooked for too long. For that, we have to work on other types of marine organisms so that we clearly understand what took place in the sediment over geological time
Cherry Picking	I chose to assess the sea-level trend from 1915-45
Cherry Picking	The most famous of these studies, published in 2010 by Paul Kench and Arthur Webb of the South Pacific Applied Geoscience Commission in Fiji, showed that of 27 Pacific islands, 14% lost area. Yet 43% gained area, with the rest remaining stable.
Cherry Picking	there has been no systematic increase in the frequency of extreme weather events,
Cherry Picking	Howard Browman, a marine scientist for 35 years, has published a review in the ICES Journal of Marine Science of all the papers published on the subject.
Red Herring	[Those who signed the Paris Accord] cannot change Earth’s orbit and radiation released from the sun that drive climate
Red Herring	An inherent bias in scientific journals in favour of more calamitous predictions has excluded research showing that marine creatures are not damaged by ocean acidification, which is caused by the sea absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. 
Red Herring	The coal industry alone supplies almost one-third of America’s electric power — with an increasing amount of clean coal-burning technology becoming available.
Red Herring	Noaa considers these floods extreme because, based on historical rainfall records, they should be expected to occur only once every 500 years.
Red Herring	So it’s been a surprise to climate scientists that 2017 has been so remarkably warm — because the last El Niño ended a year ago.
Red Herring	We have also been told the problem is DEFINITELY NOT a billions-year-old planet running through cycles where the temperature might fluctuate a bit. 
Red Herring	Sea level rise, which was occurring long before humans could be blamed, has not accelerated and still amounts to only 1 inch every ten years. If a major hurricane is approaching with a predicted storm surge of 10-14 feet, are you really going to worry about a sea level rise of 1 inch per decade?
Red Herring	Can the uncertainty monster in climate research, and particularly climate modeling, be acknowledged?
Red Herring	Carbon dioxide is a trace gas in the atmosphere.
Red Herring	Globally there’s no clear evidence of trends and patterns in extreme events such as droughts, hurricanes and floods. Some regions experience more, some less and some no trend. Limitations of data and inconsistencies in patterns prevent confident claims about global trends one way or another. There’s no trend in U.S. hurricane landfall frequency or intensity. If anything, the past 50 years has been relatively quiet. There’s no trend in hurricane-related flooding in the U.S. Nor is there evidence of an increase in floods globally. Since 1965, more parts of the U.S. have seen a decrease in flooding than have seen an increase. And from 1940 to today, flood damage as a percentage of GDP has fallen to less than 0.05 per cent per year from about 0.2 per cent.
Red Herring	But thus far, researchers do not seem to be arguing that it’s enough to counterbalance the entire human-induced warming trend.
Red Herring	Greenland ice sheet … would balloon sea levels by around 7m should it disintegrate
Strawman	The blue bars show where the raw temperature data has been adjusted downwards to make it cooler; the red bars show where the raw temperature data has been adjusted upwards to make it warmer.
Strawman	Late 20th century and early 21st century global warming, they show, is neither dramatic, nor unusual, nor scary. Here … are just some of the charts to prove it.
Strawman	But as that upper layer warms up, the oxygen-rich waters are less likely to mix down into cooler layers of the ocean because the warm waters are less dense and do not sink as readily.
Strawman	Any reasonable person can recognize both positives and negatives among the policy proposals of both Tories and Labour.
Strawman	The problem with this ploy is that carbon dioxide is not a pollutant and it is dishonest to say it is. CO2 is colorless, odorless and completely non-toxic. Plants depend on it to live and grow, and human beings draw some into their lungs with every breath they take to no ill effect whatsoever. Growers regularly pump CO2 into greenhouses, raising levels to three times that of the natural environment, to produce stronger, greener, healthier plants.
Strawman	The rapid changes in the climate may have profound consequences for humans and other species… Severe drought caused food shortages for millions of people in Ethiopia, with a lack of rainfall resulting in intense and widespread forest fires in Indonesia that belched out a vast quantity of greenhouse gas
Irrelevant Authority	Consider a rigorous study published last year in the journal Lancet that examined temperature-related mortality around the globe.
Irrelevant Authority	global warming will make the world much greener – by the end of the century, it is likely that global biomass will have increased by forty percent.
Irrelevant Authority	a killer analysis conducted by Craig Idso of all the studies which have been done on the effects of reduced pH levels on marine life.
Irrelevant Authority	In a new study out last month in the journal Nature, a team of scientists from Cambridge and Sweden point to evidence from thousands of scratches left by ancient icebergs on the ocean floor, indicating that Pine Island’s glaciers shattered in a relatively short amount of time at the end of the last ice age.
Irrelevant Authority	the ongoing rise in sea level that began with the end of the ice age continues with no great increase in magnitude.
Irrelevant Authority	Some experts, such as UN climate scientist Dr. Indur Goklany, have defended rising CO2 levels as a good thing for humanity. Goklany has argued that the rising level of carbon dioxide in the earth’s atmosphere ‘is currently net beneficial for both humanity and the biosphere generally.
Irrelevant Authority	seawater has a large buffering capacity which prevents dramatic shifts in pH;
Irrelevant Authority	in 1995 one scientist at the IPCC – Jonathan Overpeck – wrote an email to a colleague claiming ‘we have to get rid of the Medieval Warm Period.’
Hasty Generalization	Research shows that this process is overpowering the erosion from sea-level rise, leading to net land-area gain. This is not only true for the Marshall Islands. […]several studies have documented noteworthy shoreline progradation [growth] and positional changes of islands since the mid-20th century, resulting in a net increase in island area.
Hasty Generalization	While members of the media may nod along to such claims [about changes in weather extremes], the evidence paints a different story
False Cause	For what appears to be the first time since scientists began keeping track, sea ice in the Arctic and the Antarctic are at record lows this time of year.
False Cause	Pollard and DeConto are the first to admit that their model is still crude, but its results have pushed the entire scientific community into emergency mode.
False Cause	That isn’t all that ocean acidification can do. Carbon absorption can initiate a feedback loop in which underoxygenated waters breed different kinds of microbes that turn the water still more anoxic, first in deep ocean dead zones, then gradually up toward the surface[…]This process, in which dead zones grow like cancers, choking off marine life and wiping out fisheries, is already quite advanced in parts of the Gulf of Mexico and just off Namibia, where hydrogen sulfide is bubbling out of the sea along a thousand-mile stretch of land known as the ‘Skeleton Coast.’
False Cause	water vapour has been the main greenhouse gas and carbon dioxide has had a minuscule effect on global climate
False Cause	How did a wet Western winter lead to a sky-choking summer? The answer lies in the summer’s record-breaking heat, say wildfire experts. Days of near-100-degree-Fahrenheit temperatures cooked the Mountain West in early July, and a scorching heat wave lingered over the Pacific Northwest in early August.
False Cause	What are the odds that a climate model built on a system that simple would be reliable? Less than 50/50. (Multiplying .95 by itself 15 times yields 46.3 percent.)
False Cause	The end of food
False Cause	at the end of recent ice ages, the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere started to rise only after temperatures began to climb.
False Cause	One key effect will be albedo feedback
False Cause	But recent examples from other regions, like the rapidly collapsing Larsen B ice shelf on the Antarctic Peninsula, show that once ice shelves break apart as a result of warming, their parent glaciers start to flow faster toward the sea, an effect that can weaken the stability of ice further inland, too.
False Cause	Instrumental temperature measurements over the past 150 years show no correlation between human emissions of CO2 and ­temperature.
False Analogy	Already, scientists know enough to be concerned. About 120,000 years ago, before the last ice age, the planet went through a natural warm period, with temperatures similar to those expected in coming decades. The sea level was 20 to 30 feet higher than it is today, implying that the ice sheets in both Greenland and Antarctica must have partly disintegrated, a warning of what could occur in the relatively near future if the heating of the planet continues unchecked.
False Analogy	Without human intervention, the concentration of CO2 has climbed as high as 7,000 parts per million (ppm) in prior eras, whereas at present the concentration is just over 400 ppm.
False Analogy	So far this month, there have been nearly 5,000 daily record highs set or tied, compared to just 42 daily record lows.
False Analogy	Like countless other organ­isms, we move and adapt when the environment changes. Species thrive when it is warm.
False Analogy	The last time the planet was even four degrees warmer, Peter Brannen points out in The Ends of the World, his new history of the planet’s major extinction events, the oceans were hundreds of feet higher.
Vagueness	‘Next year or the year after, the Arctic will be free of ice’
Vagueness	‘This El Niño might have contributed about a quarter or a third’ of the record in 2016, said Deke Arndt, chief of the global monitoring branch at NOAA’s National Centers for Environmental Information, on a press call Wednesday.
Vagueness	[…]increases their energy costs[…]
Vagueness	But-but-but-but Alexandria Ocasio-Crazy told me we only have 12 years!
Vagueness	But the air is already so full of greenhouse gases that most land ice on the planet has started to melt.
Vagueness	Hurricanes Are Moving Slower—And That’s a Huge Problem
Vagueness	Great Barrier Reef may perish by 2030s
Vagueness	It’s safe to say [the hot Arctic] is going to have a big impact, but it’s hard to say exactly how big right now.
Vagueness	The WMO’s assessment of the climate in 2016, published on Tuesday, reports unprecedented heat across the globe, exceptionally low ice at both poles and surging sea-level rise.
Vagueness	Converting to these cleaner sources [of energy] may be somewhat costlier in the short term, but they could ultimately pay for themselves by heading off climate damages and reducing health problems associated with dirty air.
Vagueness	In 2009, then-British Prime Minister Gordon Brown predicted that the world had only 50 days to save the planet from global warming. But fifty days and years later, and the earth still spins.
Vagueness	In other words, we have, trapped in Arctic permafrost, twice as much carbon as is currently wrecking the atmosphere of the planet, all of it scheduled to be released at a date that keeps getting moved up, partially in the form of a gas that multiplies its warming power 86 times over.
No Fallacy	To revisit the ocean’s paleotemperatures now, we need to carefully quantify this re-equilibration, which has been overlooked for too long. For that, we have to work on other types of marine organisms so that we clearly understand what took place in the sediment over geological time
No Fallacy	[…]an explanation of the fluctuations of the earth’s temperatures that global warming alarmists are going to make sure to bury: The cycle of changes in the climate over the millennia is a result of changes in the amount of solar radiation, in part caused by small changes in the orbits of Earth and Mars.
No Fallacy	Sea ice has diminished much faster than scientists and climate models anticipated.
No Fallacy	With such relatively clean air throughout America, how can even reputable news agencies like Reuters continue spreading the well-worn lie that the United States is one of the ‘biggest polluters’ in the world?
No Fallacy	The Arctic also stores terrifying bugs from more recent times. In Alaska, already, researchers have discovered remnants of the 1918 flu that infected as many as 500 million and killed as many as 100 million
No Fallacy	Mass coral bleaching is a new phenomenon and was never observed before the 1980s as global warming ramped up.
No Fallacy	Back in the late 1980s, the UN claimed that if global warming were not checked by 2000, rising sea levels would wash entire counties away.
No Fallacy	’Extremely remarkable’ 2017 heads toward record for hottest year without an El Niño episode.
No Fallacy	The tropical storm, feeding off this unusual warmth, was able to progress from a tropical depression to a category-four hurricane in roughly 48 hours.
No Fallacy	 ‘and it’s only got to take one sizable volcano to erupt and all the models, everything else, is right off the board’  
No Fallacy	But the differences between NOAA and NASA aren’t that significant, Schmidt further argued, in the context of the bigger picture. ‘Getting hung up on the exact nature of the records is interesting, and there’s lots of technical work that can be done there, but the main take-home response there is that the trends we’ve been seeing since the 1970s are continuing and have not paused in any way,’ he said.
No Fallacy	as time progresses and fossil fuel emissions increase, the number of record highs should increase and record lows should decrease. 
No Fallacy	 ‘You see, gas in America is incredibly cheap, because of fracking,’ he says. But what about the risk of triggering earthquakes? He rolls his eyes.
No Fallacy	The most frequently-used range of estimates puts the likely range between 15-25cm (6-10in) above 1992 levels by 2030, and 79-155cm (31-61in) by 2100.
No Fallacy	Before human burning of fossil fuels triggered global warming, the continent’s ice was in relative balance
No Fallacy	Scientists such as Dr Willie Soon, a solar astrophysicist at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, have shown that as water vapour rises, so does temperature. It is why cloudless nights are so chilly.
No Fallacy	Temperatures in the Southwest increased by nearly two degrees Fahrenheit (one degree Celsius) from 1901 to 2010, and some climate models forecast a total rise of six degrees or more by the end of this century.
No Fallacy	Sea ice thickness also substantially declined in the latter half of the 20th century, the snow and ice data center said.
No Fallacy	Although the extent of the summer sea ice after 2006 dropped abruptly to levels not expected until 2050, the predicted 67-per-cent decline in polar bear numbers simply didn’t happen. Rather, global polar bear numbers have been stable or slightly improved.
No Fallacy	‘Arctic ice conditions have been tracking at record low conditions since October, persisting for six consecutive months’
No Fallacy	Most of the atmospheric moisture originates in the tropical ocean, and the difference between surface and upper atmospheric temperature determines how much of the moisture rises into the atmosphere. 
No Fallacy	The world’s alpine glaciers recorded a net annual loss of ice for the 36th consecutive year and the Greenland ice sheet … experienced melting over more than 50% of its surface.
No Fallacy	These facts are completely supported by 4,000 ocean floats
No Fallacy	Can the uncertainty monster in climate research, and particularly climate modeling, be acknowledged?
No Fallacy	the climate models have overestimated the amount of global warming and failed to predict what climatologists call the warming ‘hiatus’
No Fallacy	Can the uncertainty monster in climate research, and particularly climate modeling, be acknowledged?
No Fallacy	Dr Willie Soon’s comparison of temperature data and water vapour [Figure]
No Fallacy	Climate projections also assume that planet Earth is not dynamic
No Fallacy	Last year’s warmth was manifested across the planet, from the warm tropical ocean waters off the coast of northeastern Australia, where the Great Barrier Reef experienced its worst coral bleaching event on record and large scale coral death, to the Arctic, where sea ice hit regular monthly record lows and overall temperatures were also the warmest on record, at least from January through September 2016.
No Fallacy	We have known for decades that increasing CO₂ and precipitation from global warming will make the world much greener – by the end of the century, it is likely that global biomass will have increased by forty percent.
No Fallacy	Dr. Serreze said that such a situation, which would leave nothing but open ocean in summer until fall freeze-up begins, could occur by 2030, although many scientists say it may not happen for a decade or two after that.
No Fallacy	This will achieve almost nothing. My peer-reviewed research, published last November in the journal Global Policy, shows that even if every nation were to fulfill all their carbon-cutting promises by 2030 and stick to them all the way through the century—at a cost of more than $100 trillion in lost GDP—global temperature rise would be reduced by a tiny 0.3°F (0.17°C). 
No Fallacy	We simply cannot afford an agreement that puts thousands of Americans out of work[…]
