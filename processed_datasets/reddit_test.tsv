Slippery Slope	Well they should have the option to take it or not. As soon as you make vaccines mandatory my fear is the government will make other health procedures mandatory.   Dont get me wrong, I think vaccines are great and people should get them. But I do not think it would be wise to make vaccines mandatory.
Slippery Slope	Such a popular yet SO twisted opinion to have if you think about the potential and abuse this could lead to long term. People can basically justify alot of crazy stuff using that.
Slippery Slope	"I get what OP is saying but this is the definition of a slippery slope. Humans are by and large the only species on this planet who not only love, but also care for the weak (promise I don't mean that in a bad way).  Lions don't have a support group to prop up one of them that is injured or gets a thorn in their paw. They say ""fuck em"" and leave them to fix it themselves, or die.  Humans are beautiful *because* we shield, care for, and protect the outliers of our family/society.  I don't want to invoke Godwin's Law but OP's opinion is skirting dangerously close to being fanatical. If implemented, would undoubtedly be used as a baseline that would quickly morph into exterminating anyone who doesn't contribute to society, or in other words, be a burden.  Paraplegic but still have all of your cognoscent facilities? Gandpa has alzheimers? Welp, you don't contribute to society and are a 24 hour burden, toss them in the pile."
Slippery Slope	Maybe the government can tell you what color underwear and in what style you should wear, also?  Or require everyone to wear burkas, and clan turbans?  Or just decide that driving a vehicle that has more than 182hp is too unsafe for you?  Or that owning your own locking safe at home is a suspicious activity, unless you give the combination to your local police?  Or that voting is just too dangerous since no one can guarantee the right person will be elected?  Or that your gender, race, sexual orientation, beliefs, or religion should decide where you can shop?    America has lost the meaning of civil liberties, and we should all be upset about it. The government, nor the bureaucrats in it, are not your friend.
Slippery Slope	For those who can't understand....  Countries are starting to abort any abnormality nearly 100% if the time (check Iceland autism). Even if you think that's a good thing (which many would strongly disagree) you must concede that it is a slippery slope towards eugenics.
Slippery Slope	How much is enough?  If you're only giving me $1000/mo I can't really afford a nice house, and I sure can't get that new bass boat.  Maybe $5000/mo would do the trick?  But I really need a big-ass Lexus SUV to tow my bass boat, and $5000 won't cover the SUV, the boat and my McMansion.  Can I have $10000/mo, please?  It's only fair.  My neighbor down the street still works for a living and I'm envious of his swimming pool; don't I deserve one, too?  The robot that replaced me cost the company $150,000 and it will only last 10 years.  But surely I deserve more than $15,000/yr.  That's only $1250/mo, and I've already explained why that isn't enough.  Do me a solid, OK?
Slippery Slope	"Alright, so to build a tower, why not fix the foundation for 10 years before building the tower? That sounds like the right way going forward and what Massive is doing.   Sure, its going to compound problems, but that's exactly why we have Division 2, Destiny 2, and multiple ""releases"" of games. Everything is going to fall apart sooner or later as complexity increases, and thinking you could ""fix"" the foundation perfectly to avoid magnifying the problems is just hoping that the Sun don't grow into a red giant sooner or later."
Slippery Slope	Yeah why don't we just speak every sentence about a given country in that country's language
Slippery Slope	First you'll argue premartital sex is not a sin and then you'll argue abortion is not a sin because you'll want to kill a baby you made in one of your whores.  Sin just keeps balooning.
Slippery Slope	The right to assemble is a civil liberty. If they take away one civil liberty? How many can the have? All of them?  Wrong place to post. But no one will let the truth be heard!!!
Slippery Slope	Lunacy?  Allow me to introduce you to my friend.  His name is reductio ad absurdum.  If you want to be tested for every infectious disease that exists (there are many thousands), every day of your life, you think that should be free?  Now that rhetorical question is burned to the ground by it's logical counterpoint, I await an actual good faith question.
Slippery Slope	Maybe now that we have bank withdrawal and equip options, people will be more lax about it.
Slippery Slope	I agree entirely. It's a slippery slope from forced quarantine to martial law and forced curfews.
Slippery Slope	"There are so many people saying ""What's the harm?"", it's not him specifically but when you let one person surf or do whatever, then you begin to have an issue where people see this person out and allowed to do something, then it just invites more people to do the same, or cry for inequality because he's allowed on the beach and they are not. What makes him exempt from the rules?   Slaps on the wrist aren't doing it as we have people still going out and ignoring warnings. Honestly I thought this was a post from /r/Justiceporn"
Slippery Slope	First stop cannabis, next is MDMA followed by Speed, then Ice, and finally legalising Heroin.  What could possibly go wrong?  Oh right, kids may not know how to inject safely.  So we must teach primary school kids how to safely inject themselves.  It's also best to give first time users a taste while under supervision, so supervised injections for kids until they can do it safely on their own.  This will all be a win for human rights.  Nothing could possibly go wrong.
Slippery Slope	"I'd say nah because there's a huge grey area. ""oh so definitely we're taxing butter. White bread definitely, yeah the nice artisan French bread is included under that umbrella. All condiments we'll tax, ketchup is sugar and mayo is oil. Pickles too yeah, they're just pure sodium."" Etc."
Slippery Slope	The point there isn't to disparrage or discourage women. It's more akin to putting a gay man as one of the real housewives (i have never watched that show so if this actually happened i apologize).  That's not being biased against or discouraging gay men, it's just that the show isn't about them.  That's what's going on with Drag Race. Drag Race celebrates women constantly. But the show is about Drag Queens which are men.  Women have TOOOONS of shows for themselves.  This show is for drag queens to have a medium for themselves. Do you know how upset people would be if every season less and less gay men drag queens got on the show because real women got on in their stead if they started letting women on?
Slippery Slope	I think because giving in to a mob mentality is incredibly dangerous. How many people must the mob be before people must bend to their will?  Today it's a star on the street someone doesn't like.  Next it's a neighbor on a street that people want moved. I've seen first hand how these things grow fast. If you don't like Trumps politics - vote him out. Acting out / having a tantrum on his star achieves nothing.
Slippery Slope	From what I remember (from a history class) there was concern at the time that passing the ERA would outlaw gendered bathrooms. But even if that isn't true, if the ERA had passed, it most *definitely* would have been interpreted as mandated taxpayer funded abortion up to birth in all 50 states. It doesn't matter that Paul and Eastman didn't intend it that way.
Slippery Slope	We should remove all fountains globally too, right? They must use a lot of electricity.  Actually dont festivals, concerts and sporting events use a ton of resources for a few hours of hedonistic joy? We should probably stop all of those too, so the money can be spent elsewhere (for instance).  Did I miss anything? /s
Slippery Slope	"Don't like, don't read seems simple enough to me  Written fanfiction is probably the most harmless of problematic media.  And frankly I'm just glad that it's allowed to exist at all. Slippery slope arguments are shit and all, but once the policing starts it wont stop at the obvious problematic pairings with illegal age differences (is incest even considered a big issue anymore, what with GoT making it super popular on every porn site ever?), it'll continue on with other common but ""unfit for polite company"" kinks like non-consent and BDSM and then it'll come for queer pairings, and then it's women enjoying sex and at that point corporate will move in to make money off it  //edit: I want to make it clear that I'm not defending stories with pedophilic content, I'm just of the opinion there's worse issues (like the simulated child porn using 3d models that's so common nowadays) and that we have much more to lose than to gain by going down this road"
Slippery Slope	youre fucking idiotic if you think the government breaking the constitution doesnt warrant this. guns first and then what?
Slippery Slope	Either separate by gender or stop using gender to separate.  Really that simple.  If Dick and identify as Jane, then why can't 30yr old Dick identify as 14yr old Dick and claim he should be allowed to go to school?  If gender isn't science, then age shouldn't be either.  The only people who lose out are the ones with actual medical abnormalities that make gender ambiguous...lost out to people with raging, unchecked mental illness and a society that once again ignores the mentally ill.
Irrelevant Authority	It's weird because prochoice people already have met their burden of proof because the supreme court has already weighed that an unborn human life is not a person. Since science cannot prove or disprove an evolving social construct, then the supreme court ruling is as high of validity as you can get with this
Irrelevant Authority	I have a JD, an MBA, and an MSF so I am pretty well versed in the skill sets. What about a JD would make you think you could do finance?  It is a pretty in depth math program. There are some advanced math skills needed that are covered nowhere in undergrad or a JD unless you were also a finance major for BS.   This is law school arrogance at its finest. Why not a brain surgeon?
Irrelevant Authority	theyre much funnier and have actually played at the highest level, so they know what theyre talking about, at least for the mental aspect of the game. plus, ive never felt they dont believe what theyre saying, like i do w skip or stephen a
Irrelevant Authority	"I've just looked at his profile: ""Invented and led 49 new capabilities in predictive analytics, Machine Learning and AI."" While he was the global leader of analytics and Data Science at Capgemini, I think you are all just jealous, how many new capabilities in those areas have you invented...?"
Irrelevant Authority	A general rule of thumb is to decide based on what the church has historically regarded as literal, allegorical, or both. It is only a very recent development that people have been interpreting everything literally.
Irrelevant Authority	or Pros and analysts have better knowledge than random redditors.  &amp;#x200B;  I dont agree with Doinb being a bottom tier mid at worlds, imo he is mid/low mid tier but these guys played vs him and other worldclass mids or are professional analysts who spend tons of hours studying these players.  &amp;#x200B;  Thats the problem with reddit in general
Irrelevant Authority	This, or that everyones opinions are equally valid. No, the guy who has a PhD and 10years of experience in the fields opinion is more valid than your 10min google search.
Irrelevant Authority	Who gives a shit? I feel like Q is like a worn out tire that needs to be recycled. I'm serious. When one of the largest conspiracy communities on the net rejects it, is it maybe possible it's horse shit? There is plenty of other places to discuss it.
Irrelevant Authority	How do you answer the question that CAA was actually advanced by Gandhi and Manmohan Singh as PM?
Irrelevant Authority	If Chris Bledsoe isn't credible then why are these names interested in visiting him and his family? These are not nobodies....  * Jim Semivan (CIA) * Mike Morrell (CIA) * Hal Povenmire (NASA)
Irrelevant Authority	Your friend should not be refusing her doctors treatment plan
Irrelevant Authority	Are you a Harvard scientist? 
Irrelevant Authority	"Carl Gustav Jung (most prominent psychologist ever) compared Adolf Hitler to Mohammed. So to all the soyboys who claim ""oh no, you are stupid for comparing them"" -> the smartest man in psychology did it so who is stupid now?"
Irrelevant Authority	No guys you don't understand, Byrnes hit for the cycle one time, so he knows what he's talking about.
Irrelevant Authority	Are you saying that the people on r/badhistory and r/AskHistorians are wrong? Do you think you know more about the history of religion than them?
Irrelevant Authority	I'm sure you could do a much better job. This is why you are the lead designer in a game as successful as FFXIV.  Right?
Irrelevant Authority	how is it a scam if you use it as your source of vitamin c on days when you do not otherwise reach your suggested intake, or if someones diet lacks enough vitamin c in general?  they literally advertise it as immune support, not that it boosts your immune system.  let me guess, you have no background in any of this stuff, and you learned this was a scam from reddit comments?
Irrelevant Authority	The word fascism has now no meaning except in so far as it signifies something not desirable                 George Orwells
Irrelevant Authority	Ya! Let us (who know little to nothing about the inner workings of congress) call the shots in congress! Not a lifelong politician who actually has any fucking clue what shes doing!!!  /s  Stop letting your fear cause you to blame the only people fighting tyranny FOR you, while you sit comfortably at home....  When youre fighting this too (in the streets or politically) THEN youll have any room at all to talk. Until then, sit down and stop being a parent coaching from the sideline. Its embarrassing
Irrelevant Authority	Shero and Hynes know more about player development and whats best for the team and players than we do. We trusted them in the past, we need to trust them now.
Irrelevant Authority	Lol. It's a Mark Twain quote. Literally the opposite of your post.
Hasty Generalization	\#WhatRecession?
Hasty Generalization	Why trans people never shut up about being trans
Hasty Generalization	my friend converted to atheist from muslim and got abandoned by his family. how peaceful is that
Hasty Generalization	You are aware that the poem is about despicable acts that occur regularly in the Islamic backwaters right?
Hasty Generalization	You're wrong. I live in Florida and its hot right now so the globe is hot. Also it was cooler this morning than it is now, which means the globe is warming. Checkmate.
Hasty Generalization	Have you ever had anything stolen from you? Have you or your loved ones been punched in the face by a homeless guy who's high on drugs?
Hasty Generalization	Gun people aren't usually outdoorsy types. They are mostly fat and mostly have to ride 4 wheelers and other ATV's around if they go outside. They do like to imagine themselves as outdoorsy though.  Do find it funny that Mormons have such a love for firearms. Seems like Jesus would absolutely never condone firearms. He seems to prefer more primitive methods of killing people.
Hasty Generalization	Damn bro you just described all the liberals in this country too
Hasty Generalization	I would take the answer as sarcastic, BUT the I think the question was not, and I know for a fact that some women still expect this treatment. I've been given a hard time about not opening doors for women in the past. 
Hasty Generalization	You could talk about job training programs/technical schools as things people can do with really high stats in terms of job placement and earnings. Also, I'd try to say that most college educations are becoming devalued because everyone has one
Hasty Generalization	How do you spot an Atheist?   They tell you.   Also, they shit on other religious beliefs.
Hasty Generalization	Saw a bmw going down the shoulder lane on the 91 this morning. BMW drivers are dick heads. All of them.
Hasty Generalization	Most purple bud is mids.
Hasty Generalization	There's strong anecdotal evidence that bones do change even if the HRT starts after the bones fuse. Trans women have reported shifts in hip structure in their fifties, trans men have reported bone modeling in the face and feet at similar ages. I don't know if it would be enough to confuse a forensic tech tho. 
Hasty Generalization	> controls that has been proven  Ah yes, for a completely new medium, right?  Gamepads are one of the worst disconnects you can have when it comes to translating input. Completely not intuitive.  Source: I gave motion controllers (Vive wands) to my 3 and 5 year olds. They got it instantly. Then later I gave them gamepads for the Diner Duo and they struggled with it for hours. It's unnatural, we just got used to it over generations.
Hasty Generalization	I used to get flu shots every year and would get the flu every now and then. Since I quit getting flu shots, I haven't had the flu once 
Hasty Generalization	"The only people I have ever seen who care about this ""issue"" are people who are salty they are doing poorly at UTSG"
Hasty Generalization	The logic's no good.  Look at the Delphi case, they found the girls the next day, and still have released almost nothing 18 months later.  The opposite of your scenario.
Hasty Generalization	Bullshit, my half brother smokes weed constantly and he fights more than anyone I know.  &#x200B;  Edit, I'm aware its a character flaw and not a weed flaw, I wasn't saying weed makes people fight, I'm saying assholes fight, people who fight drunk are usually assholes when sober, just not as noticeable. The guy at the end of the gif is probably a calm drunk, not smoking weed. Weed isnt some magical substance that makes assholes be less of an asshole.
Hasty Generalization	I just renewed my mortgage at 3.23% that's prime less 75 basis points   I find a lot of those crying about no cheap apartment,  cannot afford house are very bought into the payment plan lifestyle.    I was brought up understanding debt is bad. The bank is not your friend. I'd rather sit on milk crates eating ramen right from the pot than pay 20% APR on press board furniture. Same goes for my 20 yr old trucks and cars. All paid for and they dont owe me anything.   It's funny how the whiners can seem to afford to eat out 4 nights a week , buy liquor smokes and dope yet demand more social programs.
Black-and-White Fallacy	Actually, it's comments like yours that prove we lag behind - there are numerous studies showing the importance of sex education. (and on a related note, show that abstinence-only education is a failure) 
Black-and-White Fallacy	To be clear, allowing totally open borders would destroy this country.  We would be first and foremost flooded by the kinds of people who want to kill Christians.  What would destroying the largest Christian nation on the planet do for the greater goal of protecting Christians and spreading our message?  If we fall China will overrun the West and you can guarantee Christianity will never be allowed to see the light of day again.
Black-and-White Fallacy	Cool...at least we are using them for science...instead of the Aborigines.  Thanks for the information.
Black-and-White Fallacy	Either you aren't as atractive as you believe, or your profile is shit.
Black-and-White Fallacy	So you would rather people put in no effort since it doesn't matter at all? You have that really weirdly warped to tag on Billionaires at the end for no reason. The rest of your argument could have gone in a logical direction.
Black-and-White Fallacy	But they are paying those people. Would you rather 1000 people with no jobs or 1 guy making a billion dollars and 999 guys making 20000 dollars?
Black-and-White Fallacy	"Just ask her, ""would you rather me go out and have sex?"""
Black-and-White Fallacy	"Seriously, games in general kept me out of a lot of trouble. My mom used to yell at me for playing games all day and all I had to say was ""Would you rather me being outside doing drugs?!""  Never had that discussion again. Then I just started to get the ""WELL LOOK WHO CAME OUT OF THEIR CAVE"" when I came out of my room."
Black-and-White Fallacy	That's the price you pay for being a civilized nation.  We can be a civilized nation with human rights and the rule of law  Or we can be like ISIS.  Take your pick.
Black-and-White Fallacy	I'm not a trump supporter (and not even from US) but I was wondering.    Is it not better to have billionaires who already have more money than they could ever spend instead of politicians who are actually all just trying to profit?
Black-and-White Fallacy	Right, but clearly ignore the way Obama put a pay raise halt on all National Park workers. Let that sink in for a bit, no different from defunding them if you refuse to give raises to their employees.
Black-and-White Fallacy	You want to live in a one party state, or you want the GOP to be replaced by a new far-right party?
Black-and-White Fallacy	I think you resent Trump because you resent Trump.   We're either free thinking adults or sheep. Blaming Trump because people take this shit to extremes is like blaming guns for school shootings.
Black-and-White Fallacy	Hmmm.  Forced socialised medicine appears to be a bad thing in this thread.  120-180 a month with no 'deductible' for healthcare seems pretty good to me.  Edit:  I like to add extra letters to words and then remove them two hours later.  I have also noticed the land of the free are constantly threatened and held at gun point to pay taxes for things they don't want to pay for.
Black-and-White Fallacy	Do you have control of the situation?  If no, then don't worry about it.  If yes, then don't worry about it.
Black-and-White Fallacy	Welp, a kid cried when their parent got caught breaking the law. Better erase all of our country's borders. 
Black-and-White Fallacy	"Yes, the ""if you want borders you're a Nazi"" crowd is far more reasonable."
Black-and-White Fallacy	But, are you okay with people not being able to travel to or from the Middle East? Muslims being banned from the US?
Black-and-White Fallacy	If you have to choose between security or liberty, you err on the side of liberty 10/10 times.
Black-and-White Fallacy	"Guys, make up your mind... Is Russia a washed-up has been, a ""broke bear"" with no power but words? Or is it an actual threat to the integrity of NATO? Because, you know, you can't fight three or four conventional wars at the same time when you're a ""broke"" country."
Black-and-White Fallacy	"There's really only a ""problem"" if you're pro-ISIS. Most normal people aren't opposed to terrorist getting blown to bits."
Ad Populum	Along with nearly every city in the world. 
Ad Populum	"""The bible is not Clear ""  it's clear enough so that there are 2.18 billion Christians   A comprehensive demographic study of more than 200 countries finds that there are 2.18 billion Christians of all ages around the world, representing nearly a third of the estimated 2010 global population of 6.9 billion.     https://www.pewforum.org/2011/12/19/global-christianity-exec/"
Ad Populum	Yeah its not just about my approval, pretty sure the majority of people in the U.S are against open carrying an AR. No one sees someone carrying a long gun in public and thinks wow look at them go, so glad they are exercising their rights. Theyre thinking Im glad I have my ccw so I can drop this motherfucker if he sneezes.   And youre right, I should just assume that all 14 year olds were taught properly on how to handle firearms even if their parents are pieces of shit. I shouldnt care if he hurts himself or someone else because if I did Id just be infringing in someones rights. Glad your parents believed you wouldnt kill someone with a gun that young. Too bad other parents believed the same thing.
Ad Populum	Don't tell me what to do!  And if it gets a lot of upvotes, the community has decided that it is worth posting.
Ad Populum	"This is a reply to everyone who replied to my post-  Godamn! Thanks for saying what I knew deep down but needed to hear. And thanks for driving the point home by all speaking from the same perspective, in such a unified concensus.  You can't argue with the hivemind, especially not when it exhibits such harmony.  ""If it's not a hell yes, it's a no"" seems to be a very sad but very true Absolute Truth."
Ad Populum	You act like DT is the only band that does meet and greets
Ad Populum	If God does not exist, why are there thousands of sophisticated apologists around the world defending his existence? Are you going to say they're all fools?
Ad Populum	Seems like the kind of thing someone with less than 300k karma would post.
Ad Populum	If you get downvoted everywhere out side of this sub then you are probably wrong and use this sub as a echo chamber to confirm your own bias.
Ad Populum	&gt;I've never been satisfied with any businesses anywhere.   If if smells like shit where ever you go, check your shoe.  Or put another way  If you run into an asshole in the morning, you ran into an asshole. If you run into assholes all day, you're the asshole.
Ad Populum	&gt;It's unhealthy  It is the opinion of the world's largest dietetics association that vegan diets are perfectly adaquete for all stages of life including pregnancy and infancy.   &gt;it's based on religious ideas and values  No, there are many secular normative philosophical arguments for veganism.   &gt;vegans are themselves rather unlikeable.  Well that's just like your opinion man. Also not a reason for continuing to support the killing of non-human animals for food.
Ad Populum	Everyone here seems to say go vegan. Remember that worldwide most buddhists eat meat.  If you do, it's good to do without it from time to time.
Ad Populum	How? The market (Humans) have literally said he's good and that's why he's worth 20M? He's up there with    * Jeff Kinney (tie) Earnings: $18.5 million. * John Grisham. Earnings: $21 million. * Stephen King. Earnings: $27 million. * J.K. Rowling. Earnings: $54 million. * James Patterson. Earnings: $86 million.
Ad Populum	And yet the game is more popular now.
Ad Populum	Skepticalscience is not a reputable source. WUWT, the world's most visited climate science site, lists SkS as an 'unreliable' source. 
Ad Populum	"There must be a firm basis to people hating Islam. There are many of us and we can't all be wrong.   Am i afraid of Islam and what it can do to this country? You are damn right i am and with good reason. With my own two eyes i have seen how it destroys countries, Islamic countries none the less. People that support this religion blowing each other up.  You are doing a dis-service to your country being ""politically correct"" in regard to Islam and your children will suffer because of it. "
Ad Populum	Why is it not biblical? There are millions of Catholics so they must be doing something right, right?
Ad Populum	If there was such a pleasure for pain and suffering, why do people prefer attractive people over ugly people? Why do women prefer dominant men over not dominant men? Why do people prefer to use cars instead of walking or taking the bus? Why do people prefer to have a good job rather than have a shitty job like working at Mc Donalds? Why would people choose to be extroverted and not awkward instead of introverted and awkward? Why do people prefer being happy over being depressed? Why do people prefer living in the richest and best neighborhoods over living in the poorest ones? So in conclusion youre wrong, were not the only ones against suffering, everybody is against obviously for themselves, there are many people who dont care about inflicting pain on someone else, but almost nobody would say they would like to experience pain.
Ad Populum	Guys, India has the highest population of Vegetarians and Hindus I think for the sake of it, no animal either it be a cow or a tiger should be harmed or consumed, we should be mature about all this, I think the government should pass a law against slaughtering of innocent animals in general, we should focus on important things like the education, job and innovation sectors, we should take a progressive stand on all of this. 
Ad Populum	I'll be honest, most of the reactions over the new films have been way too emotional. There are a number of very good critiques of the films, which IMO I think are perfectly valid. But too many people use these critiques as proof that the films are irredeemably bad, ignoring the fact that the films were generally well received by many different sources. 
Tradition Fallacy	Well it's common in Sichuan where this dish is originated from to serve it like this, so it's not a stupid restaurant plating thing it's how it should be
Tradition Fallacy	Unlockable creatures, I mean elusive units are in almost EVERY strategy card game. If it becomes strong, you either play it, it build around it. Meta is an organic, living, breathing thing. Elusives will have their turn being weak af.
Tradition Fallacy	This dates back so far in human history, how can you feel people are only pretending? 
Tradition Fallacy	It's tradition. Belts are pointless. Gis are pointless. Bowing is pointless. But it's all tradition. 
Tradition Fallacy	They have no evidence that's the world is flat, but the complexity of the Universe couldn't of just pop into existence someone made it how else do you explain the complexity of everything and almost every country or civilization has some type of God like thing how can there be so many stories and not one be true   (responding to dynami999 I just found out about the respond button so lol)
Tradition Fallacy	When you smoke you also harm the people around you, right? I myself dont eat meat too, but i dunno i dont think people should be ashamed for eating something that was normal for thousands of years. It'll just take time until we either destroy the earth or solve the problem. Oh and if people that eat meat hear tha they should be ashamed it wont convince them and wont help, they probably just get into this defensive position and eat more meat or somthing like that.
Tradition Fallacy	You don't think Bible verses and 2,000 years of historical precedent is a good enough reason?
Tradition Fallacy	Because i dont think its cruel. I lived on a farm, thats how it is.
Tradition Fallacy	Plus, we've been domesticating animals for food for thousands of years. We literally use them for food, it's ingrained in us for our survival, so why stop?
Tradition Fallacy	No, it shouldn't. Circumcision became a tradition that has held for over 2000 years for a good reason, and I see no reason to forbid parents from wanting the best for their child.
Tradition Fallacy	I'm not Christian, but if you're challenging the validity of 1800 year old commonly held knowledge in Western society, the burden of proof is *clearly* upon you, the atheist. Downvote this comment all you'd like because you don't like it, but it's still true.
Tradition Fallacy	Yes, call PETA - the animal police. Most PETA advocates are a bunch of privileged, upper class hypocrites who have no idea what the actual organisation is all about. People have hunted seals and whales for thousands of years, there's nothing wrong with traditional methods of harvesting these animals.
Tradition Fallacy	Why do we eat anything? Meat is yummy. We've been doing it for thousands of years and I'm not going to let it stop with me, god dammit.
Tradition Fallacy	Dawkins is the king of pseudointellectual thought. It's not that he's wrong, it's just that his arguments are always aimed at easy targets and ladled out with sanctimonious indignation.   Anyone who has ever taken a civics class in highschool knows the drawbacks of the electoral college. However, it's a constitutional holdover and it's stable and known. These compromises exist in all societies. The UK also still has a Monarch in charge! Gasp!  Just like debating religion, it's an intellectually lazy exercise that mostly preaches shit people already know to an audience that likes to be reassured of it.
Tradition Fallacy	Can't really change a skillcapes colour in my opinion. Something that has been around for so long that it should be left the way it is.
Tradition Fallacy	It's call Republicanism. The federal government was never meant to be involved in healthcare and education.
Tradition Fallacy	>I think that we are morally obligated to stay in Iraq and Afghanistan until we fix the damage that we caused.  This, this, Motherfucking THIS!  It's been U.S. policy since at least the Civil War to fix countries that our military has fucked up.
Tradition Fallacy	Most animals, including humans are meant to consume meat. Humans would've probably died out by eating vegetables alone. So why not doing what we were  meant to do by enjoying some salmon? Or do you actually think fish is okay since you don't think they look cute?
Tradition Fallacy	Oooook.    Nevermind the thousands of years that parents have been doing that.  
Tradition Fallacy	"It is trendy to reject anything considered ""natural"" or ""alternative"" as fake, but people forget that a lot of these practices have been going on for millennia.  It's not controversial to them.  Acupuncture facilities remain in business for a reason.  "
Tradition Fallacy	Can you tell me of any real pro sport where a person was banned for life for cheating?  If you do, I can tell you off hundreds that weren't.
Naturalistic Fallacy	How do you feel about the health risks associated with denying yourself what is one of the most natural parts of your diet? Do you feel the emotions you connect with your food are more important than your health?
Naturalistic Fallacy	Eating meat is completely natural, and can be observed in thousands of species.    Interspecies sex is incredibly rare, on the other hand.
Naturalistic Fallacy	All porn is bad its unnatural
Naturalistic Fallacy	I might be a monster here but I don't feel bad for the animals killed in the bushfires, I know they were mostly lit from people and they're worse than if they had been backburned more but it's still sort of natural if you know what I mean.
Naturalistic Fallacy	Mood af.  My mum keeps saying, Trust nature, dont interfere with it, its the best design.  Makes me have second thoughts about transitioning.
Naturalistic Fallacy	I mean that's just intrinsically a part of human nature
Naturalistic Fallacy	If eating animals is wrong then why did God make them out of food
Naturalistic Fallacy	"&gt; pewdiepie is extremely racist and very anti Semitic  A) The use of ""extremely"" and ""very"" is hyperbolical bullshit. You know it and I know it. Please stop.  B) There is nothing wrong with being racist or anti Semitic. Being tribal is a normal part of being human."
Naturalistic Fallacy	Eating meat isn't the problem, it is a natural part of the food chain going back hundreds of millions of years. Factory farming is the problem
Naturalistic Fallacy	The earth provides all. Plants water air and food. This food can be in the form of an apple or antilope, or if your a hungry enough lion an overzealous tourist . Humans have created this divide between the food that moves and the food that doesn't (animals are more than just food) but to the plants and the animals it's all the same.
Naturalistic Fallacy	Its natural for dominant creatures to eat smaller creatures. Hawk and mouse, fox and rabbit, lion and zebra. This can extend to things like snakes eating eggs. Eggs typically ok with vegetarians not vegans but the same logic applies. Bigger stronger things eat smaller weaker things. Its called nature.
Naturalistic Fallacy	You mean....like how animals.....literally eat animals....to survive. Like.....literally they die if they dont.
Naturalistic Fallacy	Thats not how this works. Thats not how any of this works.  Predatory animals in nature dont rape their prey items before eating them. A dolphin might commit necrophilia with a fish after killing it, granted, but you have a very weird concept of what eating something exactly means to the consumer.
Naturalistic Fallacy	There is neuroscientific evidence of homosexuality being natural.
Naturalistic Fallacy	98% of Sweden has been deforested at least once. Now it's a huge, almost lifeless plantation with straight rows of trees of the exact same height.  Let nature put trees where she want.
Naturalistic Fallacy	YTA humans are omnivores and veganism is a personal decision. I would equate this with *human* child abuse. Laws of nature are hard af for people these days, huh?
Naturalistic Fallacy	Humans have caused cataclysmic damage to this planet in just 2 centuries. Ever since our little Industrial Revolution.  We have gone against the grain so badly that natural selection barely applies to us anymore.  We are too far removed from nature and are no longer a true part of it, were more liken to a disease that just consumes resources in massive quantities, leaving everything else to suffer the consequences.   We do not deserve to be here, so refusing to breed and add to the population is what we do. Human extinction would be the best thing for this planet and its arrogant not to take a broader look at what weve done to the ONLY planet we have to live on and realize the same thing.   Once Earth is gone, thats it.  We are not going to find some other inhabitable planet with the exact same conditions as this one. And even if we did, why the fuck should we be allowed to spread to that one like a virus and start to consume from that one too?
Naturalistic Fallacy	It's natural to eat meat
Naturalistic Fallacy	Its more in reference to the idea that capitalism is the natural way of life.
Naturalistic Fallacy	Incorrect.  The main difference between anatural and artificial flavoris the origin of theflavorchemicals.Natural flavorsmust be derived from plantoranimal material.Artificial flavorsare synthesized in the lab.  So no, natural is not as badd as artificial.
Naturalistic Fallacy	The food chain of the animal kingdom **requires** that animals eat other animals. The entire food chain of the world would collapse without this so suggesting that it's intrinsically unethical to eat animals only makes sense if you ignore nature.  Our own history is full of needing animals for food, clothing, and to do work. This is also where the concept of pets come from. It's not wrong to be into alternative history fiction but in our real history we needed to do all of this to get to where we are so it can't be intrinsically unethical.  That said I'm all for ethical farming and pet ownership. Cruelty is unnecessary and I don't support it.
Worse Problem Fallacy	"""They're not concentration camps because it's not like they're being gassed!""   ""Concentration camps didn't start as death camps, they did become death camps, though.""   ""... They're not concentration camps!"""
Worse Problem Fallacy	"I haven't really had issues playing it. Didn't have issues with Saints Row 3 either and got a lot of downvotes because I said it was a fun game worth playing. If high performance is the only thing that will allow you to enjoy a game, why are you playing on a Nintendo Switch? And god forbid you ever play a system older than a PS3....  The amount of ""I can't play this racing game because 30 fps"" is kind of sad. Those people are lucky they didn't grow up in the 90s."
Worse Problem Fallacy	Rc is fine as it is rc hate is a circle jerk there are much worse skills.
Worse Problem Fallacy	"Anything along the lines of ""somebody has it worse"", i.e. ""there are starving children in Africa and you're complaining about your job?"".  I realize there are tons of people way less off than myself, it doesn't invalidate my grievances about work stuff or a girlfriend cheating on me or a shitty neighbor.  I'm not flying to Africa to talk to a dying kid to say how hard my life is taking care of my aging grandparents, it doesn't mean that it isn't hard though, we just live in different situations."
Worse Problem Fallacy	Adepticon hopefuls need a dose of reality, not priority buying for toy spaceships.   25% of the global population is currently on quarantine and another 40% is on restricted movement and self-imposed isolation. Adepticon is not happening this year.  Let the ship be bought by fans invested enough to know it exists.  EDIT: I am frustrated by global circumstances too, but why are you downvoting facts?
Worse Problem Fallacy	Yea because super delegates by the democrats is so much better.
Worse Problem Fallacy	Ah yes, the ol there are kids starving in Africa thing.
Worse Problem Fallacy	How about she address lower and middle income people having a hard time making ends meet?
Worse Problem Fallacy	Did we conveniently forget that a black lesbian made it out safely? Or is only the ones suffering that matter?   What about the Asian characters? Wheres the rage for them?   What about the mass amount of white characters being murdered, raped, and abused?   Why are the murded and mistreated black characters the only ones that matter?
Worse Problem Fallacy	There have been nonsense hoax papers published in philosophy, medical science, economics, and psychology journals.    https://qz.com/1422626/a-hoax-that-targeted-feminist-scholarship-accidentally-revealed-a-bigger-problem-with-academia/   If you think this one scandal is damning of the whole field, I suggest you do a bit more reading.
Worse Problem Fallacy	No, he is saying that manspreading for example is easy and joyful for the media to consume, while real problems like the climate change, forest fires etc are a battle, represented by the tank. It stands for a hard to penetrate armor, it may shoot back, which means that it is not easy to get to the bottom of such a topic and that even tho you are right you may have to deal with criticism.  Edit: No this is not a r/Woosh :)
Worse Problem Fallacy	Because THC isnt nearly on the same level as someone being drunk.  &#x200B;  You wanna test it?   &#x200B;  Put cones in a parking lot high, and drive around them.  Do the same thing drunk as shit.  They dont equate to the same thing.  &#x200B;  Also, you can only be so high before it doesnt go anywhere else  Being drunk can go as far as it wants.
Worse Problem Fallacy	Yeah, but if youre on Reddit you're probably not one of the millions upon millions of people who are starving or hungry or living in one of the shit holes of the world. Or at least that's my guess. So don't be upset someone is your age and way luckier than you, be thankful you weren't born into worse circumstances because there are likely plenty.  Also, fun fact, they've done studies and if you make around $80k in the US anything beyond that doesn't really contribute to your overall happiness. I think what's cooler about Post Malone and other wildly successful people is they are doing what they love doing. That's real success. And you don't need to be a millionaire to have it.
Worse Problem Fallacy	Two groups working towards the same goal shared some information. Big deal.  Hopefully the police will use their resources on more serious issues such as knife crime, drug gangs and scooter criminals. 
Worse Problem Fallacy	Crazy thing is I ride bart just about every day and Ive seen people smoke crack on bart/ people getting robbed and Ive seen people taking a shit in broad daylight on and off the trains but they do nothing about it yet they have time to harass people
Worse Problem Fallacy	One side is trying to kill us all and has put kids in cages.  The other isn't *quite* as progressive as we'd like.  Both sides are utter cuntyballs *bastards* amirite?  Jesus Christ people, have a sense of fucking proportion.  GOP is a shit sandwich, delivered via a massive  kick in the teeth in a filthy alley.   Democratic party is a sandwich with no butter on a paper plate apologetically placed in front of you as you watch TV.   Neither is perfect, but one is definitely way worse than the other.
Worse Problem Fallacy	Why don't feminists take up their fight to places like this?
Worse Problem Fallacy	there are a lot of people in worse shape than you. at least you still have an income.
Worse Problem Fallacy	And we think we have it hard here due to quarantine..... smh
Worse Problem Fallacy	Kids are dying of hunger in Africa and you're whining about THIS? come on man!
Worse Problem Fallacy	When I saw that some Americans were more angry about Nike not selling flag shoes than the operation of concentration camps, I just processed it as a normal part of our era. But I encourage you to sit down and take some time to really think about how utterly fucked up that is.
Worse Problem Fallacy	"What can we do about it? Nothing, it's like the least important issue that humanity has ever faced.   Ask yourself, can you think of a single celebrity who actually had their immense wealth and power actually threatened in any way by ""cancel culture""? I can't."
Worse Problem Fallacy	I find it hilarious that you find the things Bernie said in the 70s and 80s worse than what Trump is actually doing re: Russian and Chinese hegemony right now.
Worse Problem Fallacy	Meanwhile no one cares about climate change. Truly mind boggling.
No Fallacy	I assume this is not a scarastic comment , since obviously that would mean you are trying to claim the moral high ground on abln issue for which you can only do so if you never use chinese products
No Fallacy	This right here is the risk in creeping down the crest of this slippery slope.
No Fallacy	&gt;I'm as progressive as it gets  Proceeds to say something anti-progressive
No Fallacy	Slippery slope tho. Imagine it going the other way.
No Fallacy	*Things you can tell just by looking at a motherfucker, Alex.*   [https://www.ammoland.com/2017/10/which-way-will-the-ban-gun-parts-debate-go/#axzz6Hv2wksG2](https://www.ammoland.com/2017/10/which-way-will-the-ban-gun-parts-debate-go/#axzz6Hv2wksG2)
No Fallacy	I don't think the majority of residents signed up for being forced into a role under a different specialty and to use questionable PPE protocols. I know I did not.
No Fallacy	Curious, is he only charged because of our restrictions on free speech in Canada? In the US, would this not be a crime?  I am glad we charged him, but always find the slippery slope discussion regarding free speech and the American defense of it extremely interesting.
No Fallacy	I really wish everyone in Michigan would watch this. People here think we're under some tyrannical control because we can't go boating or plant gardens when it's 35 degrees and snowing. The protestors here think Whitmer is infringing on our rights. At least we have rights! At least we won't get murdered by our government for speaking out.
No Fallacy	is this a fucking slippery slope argument? god you people are so ignorant you dont even know basic logical fallacies
No Fallacy	Wonder when theyre gonna stop allowing people to post all of the outrageous conspiracy theories about coronavirus. Dozens of telephone poles have been burned or knocked down because idiots on Facebook keep posting that 5g is killing us all. Or wishing death upon scientists and health care workers because, thanks to Facebook, people know believe scientists are putting microchips and brain controlling software in all the vaccines. Facebook is starting to become a serious threat to the health, safety, and security of our country.
No Fallacy	You're allowed to leave your house. You're blowing the dictator comparison thing out of proportion, it's ridiculous.
No Fallacy	They're a threat because they're stupidly reckless. The drivers are in a position where they fear for their safety. Theses nutjobs are stupid enough to try and block a semi, who's to say one isnt willing to do something for the cause.
No Fallacy	Or we just keep legislation out of gaming maybe? That's a slippery slope
No Fallacy	Florida being fucking retarded all over again. Cool shit.
No Fallacy	I mean, publicly shaming Nazis and klansmen and counter protesting to shout louder than them? Absolutely. Letting government dictate what opinions are ok? Absolutely not.
No Fallacy	May be true, but only because Horse Armor was last gen.
No Fallacy	I dont understand this controversy. The constitution isnt going to buy you a ventilator when the inventory is exhausted. Its an exercise in legal masturbation. The rest of us live in the real world.
No Fallacy	Yeah, but thats *astro*physics, which deals with everything in Space, and Space is, like, everything *outside* of Earth and its atmosphere. I mean, hello?
No Fallacy	People are retarded. I had to walk someone through how taxes work because they were defending her by citing her degree and when I brought this up, they genuinely didn't know that there wasn't any money. I was baffled. To be that reliant on assuming shit you read in the news is true that they can't even think for themselves... it's so pathetic.
No Fallacy	"So when do they rebrand as WorryFree^(TM)?  I can't wait to live, work, and die in the same building. Mo freedom, mo worries. Solution: no freedom! Oh it's going to be great for shareholders.  ""Intellectual freedom requires intellectual work."" &amp;mdash; H.G. Creel"
No Fallacy	So Oxford University is now God? They cant make a mistake?  If Oxford said it, IT MUST BE TRUE!   
No Fallacy	Specifically what about it do you think is BS? Do you deny that there has been an increase in mean global temperature? That CO2 is a greenhouse gas? That we're increasing the atmospheric concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere?
No Fallacy	Racist - one who shows or feels discrimination against a people of a particular race, or believe ones race is superior to another Webster  You can't be racist against the virus' nationality. Sorry to break it to you.  Spanish Flu. West Nile Virus. Zika Virus. Ebola. All named after the places they came from. Are these racist too?  Instead of being concerned with Trump calling it the Chinese Virus,  perhaps folks should be more concerned with the Chinese draconian government arresting doctors that were trying to help the world avoid this disaster?
No Fallacy	"Since your a tutor I want to ask something out of curiousity.   Have you ever ran into an issue where you are teaching a student the method for solving a problem only to have them tell you that that is not how their teacher does it and won't accept your method?   I'm trying to think of a better way to phrase it but my story is basically... there was a time my sister got stuck on a math question in pre-calculus or calculus. I can't remember. I showed her how to solve it in the simplest form used all throughout my studies from HS and College (up to Cal 3 and Diff. EQ.). Her reply was ""Oh I get it! Our teacher taught us a different way though. I can't do that! My teacher will only accept her way or mark it wrong.""  I was stunned by this and annoyed cause the teachers method was comparable to 10 lines of proofs rather than just solve the proper way in like 3 lines and confused the hell out of me even!"
No Fallacy	Bernie's underlying point is right. Correlation doesn't mean causation. Money doesn't mean you know anything about politics. Money doesn't mean you know anything about business...

No Fallacy	No way. Fox News backing up Trump? Im shocked.
No Fallacy	In COVID-19, 'CO' stands for 'corona,' 'VI' for 'virus,' and 'D' for disease. Formerly, this disease was referred to as 2019 novel coronavirus or 2019-nCoV.   Does Dr. Drew not have access to Google? Why is this man on the air? Or any media at all?
No Fallacy	"Ignoring the squat, I hate the whole ""you couldn't even unrack it so you can't judge his depth"" mentality on his (and others) IG. Like, I don't need to be a michelin star chef to know that gas station sushi tastes like dogshit, and I don't need to be able to squat 788 to know what's high or not"
No Fallacy	"Her retort is an ad hominem attack?  Lame.  Attack the statement, not the person.  ""Don't judge a book by its cover"" applies here.  This is not a murder, it is a weak-minded argument from authority.  Two logical fallacies in one tweet.  Yay!"
No Fallacy	Appeal to authority
No Fallacy	Lmao, No prodigy has ever been deeply religious before.
No Fallacy	Publishers gotta eat too lolollilolololo
No Fallacy	"I'm not sure how to convey this to my left-leaning friends without sounding like a prick can you all help me with the phrasing?  What I want to say is ""Oh so its okay that CEOs have more of a voice than you when its something you agree with?"". I want to say that in a not-douchey way. I want to change minds and not just insult people.  This started wandering around my head when WalMart supposedly responded to the desires of their employees to ban OC. Since fucking when did WalMart listen to their staff and of all the things that labor is wanting or needing this is the issue that earns WalMart praise?"
No Fallacy	I had a frustrating conversation over at r/usanews a couple weeks ago with a legit boomer or older who kept insisting that Obama and Bernie radicalized the Left.  His argument boiled down to, youre young and you have much to learn...  These people dont do that - Learn. The guy was so steeped in his own bias and the smell of his geriatric urine he couldnt see the points I and several journalists were making.  Obama even said, my policies would have been considered conservative in the 80s.
No Fallacy	Why are you calling an expert a prick?
No Fallacy	Nationwide regulation has nothing to do with whether or not a country has tariffs.   Trade deficits mean nothing economically.   Keynes was the only person in this list against trade deficits according to you, which doesnt override the other 4-5 economists  Workers will have the same rights regardless of whether or not there are tariffs across the borders.   (In the US) We are already perfectly capable of creating all of these materials ourselves, its just more efficient for all parties involved (consumer, producer, worker) to outsource them somewhere else.    Rich people will profit from trade, but tariffs are the worst way to deal with income inequality.    Poor people across the world will have a share in the economy, and their lives will improve because they wont have to live off of sustenance farming.
No Fallacy	But he did it 3 times!
No Fallacy	I think it's because he speaks plainly about relevant issues and is willing to stand up for what he believes. He refreshing in an age of soundbites and platitudes. 
No Fallacy	Ah, good ol appeal to authority. Trust me, Im a doctor. Trust me, Inject this into your children. Trust me, measles is death. Its the only way. Trust me. Trust meeeeeee.
No Fallacy	"Patent,patent and patent,it's always about the same boring paper,over and over again.  What's up with these ""inventor"" and their freaking patent?"
No Fallacy	"It's not just mind-blowing but it's incredibly common as a line of argument for conservatives who deny anthropogenic global warming. I can't count how many times I've seen [the fact that 91-97% of climate scientists believe in AGW](https://climate.nasa.gov/scientific-consensus/) countered with ""APPEAL TO AUTHORITY FALLACY LOL LOGIC BOMB PWNED"" or some variation.  No, dummy, appeals to expertise are not always fallacious appeals to authority! An appeal to authority is fallacious when you're trying to prove something *simply by virtue of their authority*. When you cite the consensus of many hundreds or thousands of experts, you're not appealing to their authority, you're appealing to their body of knowledge on the relevant topic."
No Fallacy	No big deal, we just have a Secretary of State that lies as a matter of policy along with the rest of the Trump administration. Zero credibility.
No Fallacy	I'm just gonna say this: as long as tobacco cigarettes and alcohol are legal, there's no reason for weed to be illegal
No Fallacy	"I dislike these ""someone has it worse so your problems don't matter as much"" posts. Someone may have it worse, but that doesn't mean your issues and problems are less important."
No Fallacy	Just because one is worse doesnt mean the other isnt bad lmao. Top tier gatekeep
No Fallacy	Unless your new philosophy involves basically elimination everything that goes down in copper, all I have to ask is why even bother anymore? Why do you just turn a blind eye to literally all the goings on down there? Is it really just because its a minority? Honestly do you have any idea how frustrating it is when you cant even go 2 matches IN A ROW without either a team kill or someone leaving?
No Fallacy	Comparing mental health issues to the bigotry others face is impossible. They simply arent the same issue at all.   And people who say X cant feel bad because Y has it worse is like saying NO ONE except the saddest person in the world is allowed to feel pain.   Just because black trans women face a far higher and more dangerous transphobia than me, a white trans man, doesnt invalidate or trivialize my experiences with transphobia. I am not guilty for not experiencing worse. I acknowledge my privilege without guilt because it is not productive.   You can be struggling and acknowledge that others are struggling more but you still need to look after yourself and your health. How can you participate in dismantling oppressive systems in any capacity if you are not healthy enough to do so?
No Fallacy	Well, at least your problem isnt as bad as (usually something about starving African children), etc.   Yes, some people do have it worse but so what? People are allowed to feel pain and saying that doesnt solve anybodys problem. While sometimes it makes *me* feel better when I tell myself this, I would never say this to someone else.
No Fallacy	This is not a good mindset to have friend, and I hate when I hear it. Just because it could be worse in another country doesn't mean we should bypass improvement here. Why just try not to be the worst, when we could try to be the best?
No Fallacy	"I've always hated this argument. Sure there is something to said for appreciating what you have but, simply telling someone ""Hey it could be worse""  seems so devoid of any real meaning.   Yeah of course it could be bloody worse unless you are the most miserable human on the whole planet then it can always get worse.  &#x200B;  Since text can't convey tone I would like to note that I'm not attacking you for saying it. Just bitching about the line in general."
No Fallacy	According to this post, Im not allowed to enjoy literally anything because someone, somewhere, might have made themselves too fat to enjoy it. 
No Fallacy	Keep punching left, r/theDonald approves.

No Fallacy	Unless vegans/vegetarians are buying from small and sustainable local farms they are contributing to global warming, poor labor practices, etc., thus, being as responsible as everyone else for human suffering/poverty and global disaster. I am not vegan/vegetarian or buying from local sources because I'm poor af. Judgmental vegans/vegetarians are classist mfs
No Fallacy	"I've never understood this mentality ""You can't feel bad about 'X' because some other group/person had it worse"".. I mean, if you want to play that game, there's almost always someone who had it worse than you. Well, at least those kids who spent their senior trip in Vietnam didn't die from smallpox during their childhood! Or Grugnak the caveman, who fell into a tar-pit and slowly starved to death whilst surrounded by hungry vultures.. Such a pointless waste of time to gate-keep misfortune.."
No Fallacy	Comments like this are always so dumb in these threads. Why do people have to protest everything that could be bad? Do you call out people who volunteer at homeless shelters for not caring about the environment just because they focus their energies on a single topic?
No Fallacy	Now, you might think something like this is despicable. But who's really hurt here? It's all about context.
No Fallacy	> Or are you just some left-wing partisan hack who wants to give Krugman a blow-job?  Fallacy of hasty generalization.  Not all left-wing partisan hacks want to give Krugman a blow-job. One small sample does not represent an entire population.   Or are you just some right-wing partisan hack who wants to deny Krugman a blowjob?
No Fallacy	"I know this might be an unpopular opinion, but I feel like going beyond the ""is she Pinoy enough"" argument, we should ask what it says about our society that a disproportionate amount of our actors are hapas or have more white features. Idk if humanity will ever move pass valuing more attractive people and maybe we shouldn't fight that, but at the very least we can recognize maybe our taste in attractiveness unduly burdens ""regular"" Filipinos.  I don't think it's fair to blame her for being successful or to say it's just because of her looks, especially when she so happily claims her Filipino roots.  We shouldn't ignore however how she fits in more broadly to other hierarchical institutions."
No Fallacy	I mean, this is all selection bias. You can also compare Rosa Parks v. Waco. The reality is that both ways have major achievements and major failures. 
No Fallacy	"Even though I agree that farming is bs, I must say it's hilarious how people cry about this. When we had the Diretide event and people were doing their bs pudge strategy and were staying 24 hours in one match, everyone was like ""Oh that's ok, that's a good tactic"". "
No Fallacy	"This submission is a good example of a ""straw man"" argument - holding up these women as an example of feminists, to discredit all feminism. It's very common among the MRA scumbags."
No Fallacy	Ok except y'all just spent a year arguing that it has to be a red herring cause it's too obvious.   As George Lucas said, these movies are for 12 year olds. It's supposed to be simple but effective. Not wacky and incomprehensible as Rey Kenoooby theories are.
No Fallacy	Kids, this is what happens when you don't understand statistics. Just because one black person became rich and successful doesn't mean that it's not harder for minorities to do the same than whites. 
No Fallacy	This particular brand from their store is way overpriced but if you take a few minutes to actually look around you can find dress pants cheaper than jeans there. This is a pretty blatant example of cherrypicking.
No Fallacy	My life is going really well. Trump hasnt affected it at all. But I know one thing for sure.. I will never take political advice from a x stripper who raps about eating ass. If my girl needs some new techniques with her tongue Ill be sure to throw the questions your way though. Thanks 
No Fallacy	Oh, I tried telling them that before. They tell me that their grandfathers/grandmothers/father/mother(As an example my grandmother and grandfathers tell stories to me and my sisters every single time that they have 'seen' Djinns and shit) seen it by their own eyes.   I try to tell them that they have been deluded and maybe it was all dreams/imagination mixed with reality, they tell me no, they have seen it really by their own eyes(like my father who told us that he met 3 Women Djinns, 1 Djinn has even told him how many kids he will have...and it was correct!)  If they go to this route, I have little to no argument to use against them.
No Fallacy	Sounds like you're the cry baby.   It's called consumerism and when you've risen from a 70k player base over 300k, assuming everyone has purchased the base game, that is a 13 million dollar increase. Projecting I'm willing to bet that BSG assets are worth over 50-70 million easily or more.   With that said, the consumer has every right to complain and demand changes. You're talking about a fair trade off here. Us as a community are paying you for an entertainment service. This means that you also no longer have to worry about food or ever struggling through life ever again, to include future generations.   We have a right as well.
No Fallacy	There is a phenomenon in human psychology where the less you pay the more you demand and the more of an undesirable person you are.  This is why taking Groupon can be the death knell of many smaller companies.  I imagine MP subscribers are no different.  Something I've noticed happening more and more as MP has become more popular for instance is popcorn everywhere.  And I mean everywhere.  Like when I watched Star Wars someone had dumped their popcorn on the seat next to mine.  Was it a MP customer?  No idea but I'd never seen that until MP had 1 million subscribers.
No Fallacy	People just drop dead who are completely healthy. To make the assumption that somehow the government is killing people by making them work is dangerous and wrong.
No Fallacy	"""x was a y  and he did z so every y is probably a z""  This is called a strawman.  eg: Chairman Mao was an atheist and he let millions of people die, hence atheists are more prone to immorality."
No Fallacy	No offense, but why does anyone care?
No Fallacy	Maybe the Conservative party leader should set an example by not appearing on Faith Goldys podcast.
No Fallacy	does anyone in this thread understand what an outlier is?   this all reads sort of like wow. youre telling me, i can get cancer and DIE? youre telling me i could get in a car, get in a crash and DIE?! anything is possible to anyone of any age. it doesnt mean its common because it happened to one or a few people
No Fallacy	"I have a few male friends who are dating online and they often complain about all the single moms, saying things like ""they fucked douchebags and now they've been left with a kid they want a nice guy"". I am always offended at these claims and never know how to address it. What do yall think?"
No Fallacy	The North isn't playing to win, they're playing for Killboards. In a battle where the single most important thing is Titan numbers, he told Titans to dock up.                                   This is why the North is a joke.
No Fallacy	I didn't claim it was a study. I'm just saying that over the years I've seen quite a few derms mentioning they use retinol products (less than those that use tret but still), and I thought that was odd because I would think if any derm was going to use a retinoid it would be tretinoin. But I think some other comments here offered pretty good explanations for why a derm might choose retinol instead (including that they are promoting their own line of products).
No Fallacy	Not only that. Even is if *were* true, that greed is human nature, it does not follow that greed is *good*! We should, therefore, live in a society where being greedy is pointless and useless, not an advantage to be rewarded.
No Fallacy	Naturally occurring versus man made isn't that difficult to understand.   As we learn our values change to reflect our collective intelligence. Interracial marriage, gay marriage, and labor laws are all things that have been normalized due to us recognizing the failures of those who came before us. It's actually evolutionary, a guy wrote a book about it.
No Fallacy	First there were studies about how sugar is bad and now there are studies about how artificial sugar is bad.     zoom out a bit and maybe the trend seems to me to actually be- don't give your body what it perceives to be the motherload of vitality on a regular and uninterrupted basis.     maybe that's just me
No Fallacy	"Are they really carcinogenic or are they just banned under the EUs stupid policy of ""unless we have 300 peer reviewed papers plus 50 years of medical data showing its safe we are banning it ""just in case"""".  &amp;#x200B;  They banned GM crops because they were concerned of any possible side effects without any proof of those side effects ""just in case"" and utterly destroyed our nascent and world leading GM crop industry which will now be very difficult to recover."
No Fallacy	He doesn't argue that it's our purpose. Rather, it's a deeply ingrained instinct. Like sex, food and even spirituality. I don't mean religion, but the sense of awe one gets from looking up at the stars or even watching an epic movie. There's no logic to it, but the facts that underlie these instincts can be interrogated and used to make decisions about society.
No Fallacy	EZLN are not libleft, rojava is only around because it is supported by the jews and the jewish guard dog called america and the rest were all supported by the jews and still failed      your societies are anti nature
No Fallacy	Some actions objectively cause harm.  This is how we know they're objectively bad.  If you're wondering how do we know harm is bad, try holding your hand on a stove for 3 minutes.
No Fallacy	Can someone explain commerce vs capitalism?  I keep seeing arguments that capitalism is so perfect because it's existed forever because it's just the natural state (of commerce). And I don't quite have the best argument for why this is really stupid.  Is mercantilism capitalism, for instance?
No Fallacy	I mean at this point Greenpeace is just a tribe of metrosexual luddites hissing at the technology which allows them to live such luxurious lives and denying others technology to live fulfilling lives.  I mean environmental organizations should be ecstatic for Genetic engineering and I feel like the reason they arent is because they hold nature to a for lack of a better word Sacred standard
No Fallacy	"I don't think the average person really cares about preservatives in their food. I have only been to burger king a couple times in the past few months to try their impossible burger but besides that, I haven't really wanted to go there. I don't think this will cause anyone to pick burger king over mcdonalds or any other fast food just because they don't use preservatives. Wendy's has been doing the ""no preservatives"" thing for quite a few years."
No Fallacy	Racial bigotry may be natural to some extent but like, cancer is natural. Just because something's natural doesn't mean we shouldn't fight against it. Nature sucks ass sometimes and humans have the capacity to do better.
No Fallacy	I apologize if my original post came off as an attack (I think of myself as an ancom that constantly questions things), but I will thank you for your input and heed your suggestion to head to the debate sub, since I might need more philosophical insight.
No Fallacy	Yeah, any of the negative side effects seen in animal studies like cancer or neurological problems are from extremely high amounts, may more than a person could possibly consume.   And as far as some other comments about aspartame increasing fat absorption, studies show that blood triglyceride, cholesterol, and more obviously sugar levels are all lower after consuming a diet aspartame drink than a sugar drink. Im in a nutrition research program, and one of my professors has spent decades studying the effects of sugar vs aspartame. She drinks diet drinks with aspartame, because her research and others point to aspartame being healthier. Just because it is synthetic doesnt mean its bad for you.
No Fallacy	"The title makes it sound as if it's necessarily a bad thing. Taking a drug that ""alters brain function"" to turn yourself into a semi-functional person is way better than years of suffering despite the obvious risks for side effects."
No Fallacy	> You can't go wrong with nature.  You definitely can. Just because it's outside doesn't mean it's healthy or even safe to eat.
No Fallacy	He explicitly stated that just because lobsters do it doesn't mean that it's natural or that we should emulate its merely on observation that we may have an evolved hierarchy ie that our current hierarchies aren't purely social constructs like many people assert.
No Fallacy	"Using the ""nature argument"" here. Ya don't see male or female animals legit fucking each other, yes some males will hump males to show dominance but that's as far it goes. (Besides girrafes, those guys are freaky)  So being straight isn't a hoax it's a matter of make offspring to continue the race."
No Fallacy	Don't know why people are down voting you:   Bacon: 40mg/kg nitrites, though other sources state 100mg/kg Cabbage: 600mg/kg Chard: 970mg/kg    Hastily sourced Sources: http://www.foodstandards.gov.au/consumer/additives/nitrate/documents/Survey%20of%20nitrates%20and%20nitrites.doc  www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5412236/  https://chriskresser.com/the-nitrate-and-nitrite-myth-another-reason-not-to-fear-bacon/
No Fallacy	no it's a plant
No Fallacy	Is there context to these tweets?    They seem to be in response to something and it's like there is a part of the story missing?    I don't use twitter so maybe I'm reading it wrong?
No Fallacy	How would you feel about Donald Trump setting the standards for the test after taking office?
No Fallacy	irrespective of the quality i think this is far more interesting than the soon to be dead 'one day cricket'
No Fallacy	Argumentum ad populum? On Reddit, the last bastion of logical thinking? /s
No Fallacy	Me: 2+2=4  You: FAQ says 2+2=5, so youre wrong   Sorry buddy. I dont think thats how this works.
No Fallacy	Yeah, what he said.
No Fallacy	What's the relationship between the EC and libertarianism?
No Fallacy	False. The burden of proof does not fall on whoever engages the debate first. It falls on who needs to debunk or disprove the already popular theory/evidence for X theory. For example, we have tests that prove the Earth is spherical, we have dozens of witnesses that have said it was spherical, we have satellite photos and videos of Earth rotating also showing it's spherical, and much more evidence. Therefore it's already the established theory that the Earth is globular and not flat, and the burden of proof falls on whoever wishes to prove it is flat.  Similarly, theists claim there is a god or gods. There has been no evidence proving such a entity or entitys exist by any evidence based theory. Therefore, the burden of proof falls on you and other theists, because you have to disprove the evidence atheists have for a lack of gods existence.
No Fallacy	Hilarious.  Over a hundred pages long and the author excludes the possibility of the supernatural by fiat in the second paragraph.     Well, I guess thats one way to exclude God. Define your terms such that it is impossible for him to exist.   Good grief. 
No Fallacy	People are conflating expression with argument.   Expressing one's opinion is not necessarily an attempt to bring others to it.
No Fallacy	"Well Bearing made like 4 videos about Vegan Gains and agreed to debate him. Kraut and Bearing just relied on appeals to tradition and popularity and when VG shut them down with the slavery and murder analogies then they used the ""I don't care"" excuse. They came unprepared it seemed like. "
No Fallacy	Damn, projection and argumentum ad populum in one screenshot.
No Fallacy	Where did these numbers come from? Crazy to think that a 2016 Post album would be able to outsell Cole
No Fallacy	"Are we doing this sort of shit now?   I don't know my fallacies but what is it called when someone says ""Multiple people say they knew X and that X did not rape/murder/assault them. Therefore X never raped/murdered/assaulted people"""
No Fallacy	These posts getting 80%+ in upvotes says to me 80%+ of the people *subscribed* are in the wrong subreddit.    
No Fallacy	In general, using any kind of metaphores as an actual argument is a huge pet peeve of mine.
No Fallacy	"Is that the royal ""we"" ?"
No Fallacy	People are instinctively driven to protect children. Invoking the welfare of children as a reason to disarm is a play on that instinct. 
No Fallacy	Outrage culture. The fact that the accusation is enough to ruin someone. The cringe tumblr culture. Instant gratification
No Fallacy	&gt; I have my own head canon thats only the OT and PT, but deep down I know its denial.  Not if we all refuse to recognize Disney's rubbish as canon. We could agree that the OT, PT, and the old EU are canon; the ST and Disney's new and unimproved EU are not.   It may feel like denial, but is it? Why should Disney be the final arbiter of what is or is not considered canon?
No Fallacy	Lol what? Like skip ahead? Whats the point of the queue then?
No Fallacy	You spend too much time on Reddit. When I started traveling I realized that people go out of their way to help beyond the boundaries of caste, color, creed, gender, or religion. Roads have improved by leaps and bounds. Things are improving even if slowly but they are. There has to be more good people than bad otherwise the system would have collapsed.
No Fallacy	Change for the sake of change doesnt necessarily equate to a change for good.
No Fallacy	That could still be true, what is the context  This might be a case of the is/ought distinction
No Fallacy	It is an aspect of a culture, it isn't an acceptable thing.
No Fallacy	"""That's how we've always done it."" "
No Fallacy	No
No Fallacy	"I think I might be the only person not looking forward to this game, just because the witcher was good doesn't mean this will be. I just feel a bit ""meh"" every time I read or watch more about it. I hope it's good either way for people into futuristic games, I just don't think it'll blow my mind like witcher did. "
No Fallacy	Sikhs and Hindus don't acknowledge the Bible, but I'm sure they have their own reasons why same-sex relationships are sick and wrong.
No Fallacy	The problem is two parts. The first is the technical definition of money, as in the purpose of exchange past a barter system, can be anything. But historically it has been gold. Simply because those who have real wealth needed something to trade with counter parties that could be universally accepted and secure as a store of value.  The second part is the real world example of nations and central banks use gold to establish the credibility of a currency. All central banks and nations hold some gold reserves for monetary reasons. Monetary being the purchasing power of their currency without it being specie.
No Fallacy	This sets a really bad precedent. You may not agree with the name, but what is going to stop them from doing this to other companies/etc...?  I mean, who is the trademark office to say what someone can and can't name something when it's already been named that?
No Fallacy	[Appeal to Tradition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeal_to_tradition)
No Fallacy	Fallacy: [Appeal to Novelty](http://www.nizkor.org/features/fallacies/appeal-to-novelty.html)  Newer policy is not automatically better than older policy.  I hate Santorum, but there are quite a few policies I would like to go back in time to.
No Fallacy	"I think it should be taken off but I like the explanation I heard for why it's still on the - basically phrases like ""in God we trust"" are so common as to become meaningless. Not the best answer but I'll take it. "
No Fallacy	Ridiculously long copyrights kills innovation.
No Fallacy	The judge really pulled out the good ol' slippery slope argument in his ruling:  > When a federal court is obliged to confront a constitutional struggle over what is marriage, a singularly pivotal issue, the consequence of outcomes, intended or otherwise, seems an equally compelling part of the equation. It seems unjust to ignore. And so, inconvenient questions persist. For example, must the states permit or recognize a marriage between an aunt and niece? Aunt and nephew? Brother/brother? Father and child? May minors marry? Must marriage be limited to only two people? What about a transgender spouse? Is such a union same-gender or male-female?  
No Fallacy	It's...a play on a common phrase...a phrase OP didn't coin. Grow a sense of humor.
No Fallacy	There is no debate. The Church has clearly and unambiguously understood these passages and there was no question at all at to what they meant until just the last few years - when we have people motivated to confuse the issue.  
No Fallacy	"Yeah, and she responded ""We've been doing it for four years and it hasn't happened *yet*...so...""  Whoopsie"
No Fallacy	"&gt;we shouldn't try to fix pollution?  If we actually tried to ""fix"" pollution we wouldn't be fussing around with straws :l"
No Fallacy	Are we not allowed to dislike people for being giant douchebags anymore? 
No Fallacy	Atheism isnt a positive claim. It cant be believed it is just the lack of belief in a god or gods.
No Fallacy	I love how blind defenders always deal in extremes. I cant max one unit out says complaint, if you want EVERYTHING fuck off replies idiot. THERES A FUCKING MIDDLE GROUND. 
No Fallacy	Idk what happened.  Must be aliens.
No Fallacy	Yeah, they should just call bootcamp graduates who will educate them on the intricacies of the latest React fad, lmao.
No Fallacy	Psuedo-philosophical question here:  If the person is stupid, because he was born stupid, isnt he just as innocent as the crocodile? The croc was born stupid and doesnt know any better than to bite, so we forgive him. Why dont we forgive the stupid human that doesnt know any better than to stick his hand? In this situation both got punished for being stupid, so why do we only feel sympathy for the animal with 4 legs but not the one with 2?
No Fallacy	Then why dont you start a movement m8. This definitely isnt an unpopular opinion, but every movement starts somewhere. Fat acceptance for women certainly didnt start just bc a few people complained about it. You need to spread your message if you want to see change.
No Fallacy	"Do we need to upvote this tired B.S. every time. Both terms make no sense... ""pro-life"" is not for ""life"" in general, and ""pro-choice"" is not for ""choice"" in general. Orwellian branding is on both sides. If we can move past that maybe we can discuss things on merit, rather than constantly philosophize about the names.  **EDIT**: Downvoted for saying ""we should discuss things on merit"". You folks have shit for brains."
No Fallacy	If you spend a lot of money on something you automatically become resistive to anything that would make having spent that money a bad idea.
No Fallacy	I think because for men to have sex they have to use a womans body it becomes a defensive thing for women. Women do not want to have with men they dont want to have sex with full stop. Admitting its a need admits they have to have sex with men they dont want to. I personally dont think its a need but an extreme want. I wish prostitution was legal for these men though.
No Fallacy	id rather get some kills and die than land at the edge of the map to play loot simulator and hide the entire match
No Fallacy	The ship of Theseus.  Imagine there is a boat made of 100 different parts, and every year one these parts is replaced. It is always a different part that is replaced. After 100 years the ship is still sailing strong. Then some person comes along and buys the shipyard where the replaced parts are stored and builds a ship of his own.   Now which one is the original ship?
No Fallacy	"Yeah, I too would probably find it pretty off-putting if someone introduced himself like, ""Hey, I'm Steve, and I love putting dicks in my mouth."" Luckily that's happened to me exactly zero times."
No Fallacy	Why won't orange man start a war? 
No Fallacy	You are depressed that a sitting President didn't collude with Russia? WTF is wrong with you?
No Fallacy	So what you're saying is that the mining rig manufacturers are one day going to decide that they only want to sell their product to as few people as possible.  Sounds legit.
No Fallacy	Dude I got stuck at challenges scientific assumptions...  Um, thats not really how science works. Or rather, if you want to challenge a scientific finding, youll need to devise an alternate theory and design a study to attempt to disprove your own assumption.   Challenging scientific assumptions isnt sticking your fingers in your ears and repeating not true not true not true ad nauseum on tumblr. Thats not how this works. 
No Fallacy	Nobody knows, as we cant peer back before the Big Bang.  We can theorize about all sorts of things, such as bubble universes and multiverses, but not knowing doesnt imply we should conclude god did it.  Science is all about getting comfortable with not knowing, and living with a certain amount of uncertainty when it comes to big questions.
No Fallacy	Two opposite opinions and purity tests. These opinions usually start as pretty moderate but become more different and radical due to purity tests. If you are agree with 99% of the group's ideas but in doubt about the other ones, you are a potential traitor. Plus radicals are usually more confident and vocal and being in doubt is seen as weak trait, so people are more likely to side with them.   Oh, and good old black-and-white thinking plays a big role here. And the whole us-versus-them mentality. 
No Fallacy	>The only thing I am sure of is that both sides are flooding us with disinformation and appear to have much [to] hide.   Assuming *arguendo* that is correct:  * Disinformation from the Trump side is motivated by a desire to conceal illicit activity  * Disinformation from the Mueller side is motivated by a desire to reveal illicit activity  They are not equivalent.
No Fallacy	Good, it's nice that the Linux world has at least one modern desktop. If it were up to the community Linux would still look like windows 95 or everything would be bloated as fuck for the sake of not breaking compatibility.  Honestly it's mostly microsoft shills spreading this stuff. They can't make their OS good so they want everyone else to suffer too. 
No Fallacy	I believe that women should be treated the same as men, and if you don't agree will you tell me you're not sexist?
No Fallacy	It's still a multiplayer sandbox game and it's not released yet! So just wait for the full game, before you complain about content. I personally prefer a game with less mechanics that feel immersive and fit in with the world over a map full of small objectives that feel more like a chore than an adventure. Yeah, SoT is not for everyone, but it as of now it looks like a pretty good game to mess around with your friends.
No Fallacy	It's called the Black and White Fallacy.  Basically stating there are only two options or possible positions and that ambiguity cannot exist.  American politics thrive on this one.
No Fallacy	Taxation is theft? Where the fuck do you think your roads come from? Public transport, basic infrastructure, healthcare, national defense, social security, food stamps, housing assistance, programs for abused, disabled, neglected, homeless, veterans, retirees, scientific & medical research, education, job training, immigration, border patrol, police, litigation, embassies, energy utilities, space program, mortgage credit, water and waste disposal, and paying interest on your national debt. You can either live in the 3rd world slums or get taxed.    
No Fallacy	Verdadeiramente um dos grandes problemas dos nossos tempos.
