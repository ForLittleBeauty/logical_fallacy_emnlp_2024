Evading Burden of Proof	In other words, we have, trapped in Arctic permafrost, twice as much carbon as is currently wrecking the atmosphere of the planet, all of it scheduled to be released at a date that keeps getting moved up, partially in the form of a gas that multiplies its warming power 86 times over.
Evading Burden of Proof	With more CO2 in the atmosphere, the challenge [feeding 2.5 billion more people] can and will be met.
Evading Burden of Proof	tornadoes will grow longer and wider
Evading Burden of Proof	One of the main areas of contention is the existence of two strange climate episodes known as The Medieval Warm Period (MWP) and the Little Ice Age. The MWP lasted from about 950 to 1250AD, and temperature 
Evading Burden of Proof	In the sugarcane region of El Salvador, as much as one-fifth of the population has chronic kidney disease, including over a quarter of the men, the presumed result of dehydration from working the fields they were able to comfortably harvest as recently as two decades ago.
Evading Burden of Proof	The human contribution can be up to 30 percent or so of the total rainfall coming out of the storm
Evading Burden of Proof	Scientists are also expecting a ‘huge reduction’ in solar activity for 33 years between 2020 and 2053 that will cause thermometers to crash.
Evading Burden of Proof	Shelters in poorer countries are not repainted as often, and darker stations absorb more of the sun’s energy.
Evading Burden of Proof	The new research showed that [oxygen isotopes in foraminifera] can change
Cherry Picking	Whether Antarctic mass loss keeps worsening depends on choices made today
Cherry Picking	This chart gives you a good idea of the direction of the adjustments.
Cherry Picking	International Energy Agency, a global analysis organization, continue to see a role for coal for the foreseeable future.
Cherry Picking	The bottom line is there’s no solid connection between climate change and the major indicators of extreme weather
Cherry Picking	The ongoing global bleaching event is the longest-lasting one ever observed, and only the third ever seen. It has occurred during the warmest year on record, which occurred in 2015, and the two most unusually mild months on Earth, which took place in January and February, respectively.
Cherry Picking	Computer models of the climate are at the heart of calls to ban the cheap, reliable energy that powers our thriving economy and promotes healthier, longer lives.
Cherry Picking	This is a critical error. Getting the tropical climate right is essential to understanding climate worldwide.
Cherry Picking	The news comes amid mounting evidence that the recent run of world record high temperatures is about to end.
Cherry Picking	 NASA concurred with NOAA, also declaring 2016 the warmest year on record in its own data set that tracks the temperatures at the surface of the planet’s land and oceans, and expressing ‘greater than 95 percent certainty’ in that conclusion. (In contrast, NOAA gave a 62 percent confidence in the broken record.) 
Cherry Picking	there are alarming stories every day, like last month’s satellite data showing the globe warming, since 1998, more than twice as fast as scientists had thought
Cherry Picking	I conclude that it must be ice accumulation, through evaporation of ocean water, and subsequent precipitation turning into ice. Evidence suggests that accumulation of ice on the Antarctic continent has been offsetting the steric effect for at least several centuries.
Cherry Picking	While record low sea ice is nothing new in the Arctic, this is a surprising turn of events for the Antarctic. Even as sea ice in the Arctic has seen a rapid and consistent decline over the past decade, its counterpart in the Southern Hemisphere has seen its extent increasing.
Cherry Picking	Representatives from the Marshall Islands have been vocal about the need for strong global action on climate. President Hilda Heine has told reporters that longtime residents are leaving the Marshall Islands because climate change is threatening the nation’s existence.
Cherry Picking	The particular signature of warming in 2016 was also revealing in another way, Overpeck said, noting that the stratosphere… saw record cold temperatures last year
Cherry Picking	For example, Canadian polar bear biologist Ian Stirling learned in the 1970s that spring sea ice in the southern Beaufort Sea periodically gets so thick that seals depart, depriving local polar bears of their prey and causing their numbers to plummet. But that fact, documented in more than a dozen scientific papers, is not discussed today as part of polar bear ecology.
Cherry Picking	European average ​temperatures were more than 2C above normal 
Cherry Picking	This means the global temperature trend has now shown no further warming for 19 years
Cherry Picking	It has never been shown that human emissions of carbon dioxide drive global warming.
Cherry Picking	Instead of a three-foot increase in ocean levels by the end of the century, six feet was more likely, according to DeConto and Pollard’s findings. But if carbon emissions continue to track on something resembling a worst-case scenario, the full 11 feet of ice locked in West Antarctica might be freed up, their study showed.
Cherry Picking	Until now, scientists have calculated the temperature of the ancient seas by looking at foraminifera, the fossils of tiny marine organisms found in the sediment on the ocean floor.
Cherry Picking	 It has now, even after Hurricane Matthew, been over 4,000 days since a major hurricane (Category 3 or stronger) has made landfall in the U.S. 
Red Herring	We may not be able to stop it, but we’d better get ready to adapt to it.
Red Herring	It seems self-evident that rising sea levels will reduce land area. However, there is a process of accretion, where coral broken up by the waves washes up on these low-lying islands as sand, counteracting the reduction in land mass. Research shows that this process is overpowering the erosion from sea-level rise, leading to net land-area gain.
Red Herring	Global human emissions are only 3 per cent of total annual emissions.
Red Herring	 ‘and it’s only got to take one sizable volcano to erupt and all the models, everything else, is right off the board’  
Red Herring	CO2 is not powerful in that sense, the only thing it does in the system is make the planet greener.
Red Herring	the satellites now show that in recent months global temperatures have plummeted by more that [sic] 0.6 degrees
Red Herring	whenever in the past there was an explosion of plant life, the carbon dioxide content was far higher than at present.
Red Herring	[…]even if the countries of the world agree to do what they promised on climate change, […]the promised actions will have no measurable effect on future global temperatures.
Red Herring	climate economists see a positive externality, not a negative one, from the human influence on climate. (In technical lingo, the so-called social cost of carbon would be negative.)
Red Herring	Entire states and nations have to decide to clean up their energy systems, using every tool available and moving as quickly as they can.
Red Herring	The fall, revealed by Nasa satellites, has been caused by the end of El Nino
Red Herring	But-but-but-but Alexandria Ocasio-Crazy told me we only have 12 years!
Red Herring	Moreover, its warming impact decreases sharply after the first 20 or 30 ppm. Adding more CO2 molecules to the atmosphere is like painting over a red wall with white paint — the first coat does most of the work of concealing the red. A second coat of paint has much less of an effect, while adding a third or fourth coat has almost no impact at all.
Strawman	This scientist proved climate change isn’t causing extreme weather 
Strawman	Unlike genuine pollutants, carbon dioxide (CO2) is an odorless, colorless gas. Every human being exhales about two pounds of CO2 a day, along with a similar amount of water vapor. CO2 is nontoxic to people and animals
Strawman	The term ocean acidification was also a misnomer, he said, because it suggested that the oceans could become acidic instead of alkaline. 
Strawman	New Report Warns High Likelihood Of Human Civilization Coming To An End Within 30 Years
Strawman	Climate change might be worse than thought after scientists find major mistake in water temperature readings The sea was much colder than previously thought, the study suggests, indicating that climate change is advancing at an unprecedented rate
Strawman	The research challenges the ways that researchers have worked out sea temperatures until now, meaning that they may be increasing quicker than previously suggested.
Strawman	what this study proves is that there is nothing we can do to stop the Earth’s naturally occurring climate cycles.
Irrelevant Authority	But it is part of a long list of studies from independent teams (as this interactive graphic shows), using a variety of methods that take account of critical challenges, all of which conclude that climate models exhibit too much sensitivity to greenhouse gases.
Irrelevant Authority	[Pruitt’s statement] was an accurate and judicious answer
Irrelevant Authority	In responding to the IPCC report, our message as scientists is simple:
Irrelevant Authority	Atmospheric scientist John Christy developed a global temperature record of the lower atmosphere using highly accurate satellite soundings.
Irrelevant Authority	In 2004, two NOAA scientists, Richard Feely and Christopher Sabine, produced a chart showing a strong correlation between rising atmospheric CO2 levels and falling oceanic pH levels. But then, just over a year ago, Mike Wallace, a hydrologist with 30 years’ experience, noticed while researching his PhD that they had omitted some key information[…] his results were surprising: there has been no reduction in oceanic pH levels in the last -century.
Irrelevant Authority	that is a sign the underlying global warming trend is stronger than ever.
Irrelevant Authority	on average, the projected heating by the models is three times what has been observed.
Irrelevant Authority	Not only do polls suggest the public is unmoved at home and in abroad…
Irrelevant Authority	Scientists used to think that ice sheets could take millennia to respond to changing climates
Irrelevant Authority	In 2013, scientists reached a consensus that three feet was the highest plausible rise by the year 2100. But now some of them are starting to say that six or seven feet may be possible.
Hasty Generalization	Temperatures in the Arctic have soared recently, and scientists are struggling to explain exactly why.
Hasty Generalization	Previous satellite estimates of modern ice losses tried to take this into account, but precise new GPS data showed much of Greenland is rising far more rapidly than thought, up to 12mm a year. This means 19 cubic kilometres more ice is falling into the sea each year, an increase of about 8% on earlier figures.
False Cause	Could natural factors be the cause of the warming? Nope.
False Cause	There’s no trend in global droughts. Cold snaps in the U.S. are down but, unexpectedly, so are heatwaves.
False Cause	Global sea level rise surged between November 2014 and February 2016, with the El Niño event helping the oceans rise by 15mm.
False Cause	According to the study, scientists also discovered that during this period of Global Warming there were no ice sheets covering either Greenland or West Antarctica, and much of the East Antarctic ice sheet was gone.
False Cause	We have also been told the problem is DEFINITELY NOT a billions-year-old planet running through cycles where the temperature might fluctuate a bit. 
False Cause	Do we really believe that one bellowing fan in a crowd of 85,000 at the MCG can completely change the course of a game?
False Cause	The effect of long-term warming is to make it harder to count on snowmelt runoff in wet times
False Cause	The chain of events that links the melting Arctic with weather to the south begins with rising global temperatures causing more sea ice to melt. Unlike on the Antarctic continent, melting ice here exposes dark ocean beneath, which absorbs more sunlight than ice and warms further. This feedback loop is why the Arctic is heating up much faster than the rest of the planet.
False Cause	The news comes amid mounting evidence that the recent run of world record high temperatures is about to end.
False Cause	…scientist James Hansen unequivocally stated: ‘We have at most ten years—not ten years to decide upon action, but ten years to alter fundamentally the trajectory of global greenhouse emissions.'
False Cause	He also said that silt washing into the ocean from the world’s major rivers, including the Mississippi, the Amazon and the Nile, is contributing to sea-level rise.
False Analogy	The surprising thing is that the Energy Balance estimates are very low compared to model-based estimates.
False Analogy	Moreover, its warming impact decreases sharply after the first 20 or 30 ppm. Adding more CO2 molecules to the atmosphere is like painting over a red wall with white paint — the first coat does most of the work of concealing the red. A second coat of paint has much less of an effect, while adding a third or fourth coat has almost no impact at all.
False Analogy	the basic rule for staple cereal crops grown at optimal temperature is that for every degree of warming, yields decline by 10 percent. Some estimates run as high as 15 or even 17 percent. Which means that if the planet is five degrees warmer at the end of the century, we may have as many as 50 percent more people to feed and 50 percent less grain to give them.
False Analogy	Already, scientists know enough to be concerned. About 120,000 years ago, before the last ice age, the planet went through a natural warm period, with temperatures similar to those expected in coming decades. The sea level was 20 to 30 feet higher than it is today, implying that the ice sheets in both Greenland and Antarctica must have partly disintegrated, a warning of what could occur in the relatively near future if the heating of the planet continues unchecked.
False Analogy	This means that the world is now 1C warmer than it was in pre-industrial times
Vagueness	But the observed warming as monitored by satellites (our only truly global monitoring system) has been only about half of what computerized climate models say should be happening.
Vagueness	Protecting and restoring forests would reduce 18% of emissions by 2030
Vagueness	Coral bleaching has devastated 93% of the Great Barrier Reef
Vagueness	Entire states and nations have to decide to clean up their energy systems, using every tool available and moving as quickly as they can.
Vagueness	And some plants – like algae which use carbon for photosynthesis – may even benefit.
Vagueness	The acceleration is making some scientists fear that Antarctica’s ice sheet may have entered the early stages of an unstoppable disintegration.
Vagueness	But the new research shows that the amount of oxygen in those shells doesn’t actually remain constant over time.
Vagueness	The problem with this ploy is that carbon dioxide is not a pollutant and it is dishonest to say it is. CO2 is colorless, odorless and completely non-toxic. Plants depend on it to live and grow, and human beings draw some into their lungs with every breath they take to no ill effect whatsoever. Growers regularly pump CO2 into greenhouses, raising levels to three times that of the natural environment, to produce stronger, greener, healthier plants.
Vagueness	Not everyone is convinced that the evidence is in that climate change is responsible for extreme swings between drought and deluge.
Vagueness	a constant swarm of out-of-control typhoons and tornadoes and floods and droughts
Vagueness	the first scientists to show that the thick icecap that once covered the Arctic ocean was beginning to thin and shrink.
Vagueness	and we will need to have invented technologies to extract, annually, twice as much carbon from the atmosphere as the entire planet’s plants now do
Vagueness	Recent computer forecasts suggest that if greenhouse gas emissions continue at a high level, parts of Antarctica could break up rapidly, causing the ocean to rise six feet or more by the end of this century. That is double the maximum increase that an international climate panel projected only four years ago. But those computer forecasts were described as crude even by the researchers who created them. ‘We could be decades too fast, or decades too slow,’said one of them, Robert M. DeConto of the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. ‘There are still some really big question marks about the trajectory of future climate around Antarctica.’
Vagueness	data] show only slight warming, mostly at night and in winter
No Fallacy	Stress from unusually warm ocean water heated by man-made climate change and the natural El Niño climate pattern caused the die-off.
No Fallacy	In its 5th assessment report in 2013, the IPCC estimated that human emissions are probably responsible for more than half of the observed increase in global average temperature from 1951 to 2010. But it means a chunk of the rise is coming from elsewhere.
No Fallacy	While transient weather variability is playing a key role here, the widespread record warmth across the U.S. so far this year is part of a long-term trend toward more warm temperature records versus cold ones.
No Fallacy	The buoy temperatures, which are measured by precise electronic thermistors, were adjusted upwards to match the questionable ship data. Given that the buoy network became more extensive during the pause, that’s guaranteed to put some artificial warming in the data.
No Fallacy	‘Continued investment in climate research and observations is vital if our scientific knowledge is to keep pace with the rapid rate of climate change.’
No Fallacy	The amount of summer sea ice in the Arctic has steadily declined over the past few decades because of man-made global warming, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
No Fallacy	Instead of a three-foot increase in ocean levels by the end of the century, six feet was more likely, according to DeConto and Pollard’s findings. But if carbon emissions continue to track on something resembling a worst-case scenario, the full 11 feet of ice locked in West Antarctica might be freed up, their study showed.
No Fallacy	The ‘ancient carbon’ of Alaska’s tundras is being released, starting a vicious warming cycle ‘This is ancient carbon, thousands and millions of years old.’ It’s being released ‘much earlier than we thought.
No Fallacy	at least four feet of sea-level rise and possibly ten by the end of the century
No Fallacy	Sea level rise is global. But due to a variety of factors – including, for this part of the Atlantic coast, a likely weakening of the Gulf Stream, itself potentially a result of the melting of Greenland’s ice caps – south Floridians are feeling the effects more than many others. While there has been a mean rise of a little more than 3mm per year worldwide since the 1990s, in the last decade, the NOAA Virginia Key tide gauge just south of Miami Beach has measured a 9mm rise annually.
No Fallacy	The Northern Hemisphere jet stream […] flow is stronger when that temperature difference is large. But when the Arctic warms up faster than the equator does […] the jet stream’s flow can become weakened and elongated. That’s when you can get the resultant weather extremes.
No Fallacy	The jet stream forms a boundary between the cold north and the warmer south, but the lower temperature difference means the winds are now weaker. This means the jet stream meanders more, with big loops bringing warm air to the frozen north and cold air into warmer southern climes.
No Fallacy	if oceans do become warmer due to ‘climate change’, the effect will be for them to ‘outgas’ CO2, not absorb more of it
No Fallacy	The melting Greenland ice sheet is already a major contributor to rising sea level and if it was eventually lost entirely, the oceans would rise by six metres around the world, flooding many of the world’s largest cities.
No Fallacy	And this winter’s near disaster at the overflowing Lake Oroville was in part caused by warm storms too.
No Fallacy	The review found that many studies had used flawed methods, subjecting marine creatures to sudden increases in carbon dioxide that would never be experienced in real life. In some cases it was levels far beyond what would ever be reached even if we burnt every molecule of carbon on the planet 
No Fallacy	the rapid ice loss recorded by satellite measurements over the last 20 years is not likely to be a blip, but part of a long-term trend being exacerbated by climate change. Global warming is driving major melting on the surface of Greenland’s glaciers and is speeding up their travel into the sea.
No Fallacy	2017 is so unexpectedly warm it is freaking out climate scientists
No Fallacy	It has yet to be demonstrated that the climate change today is any different from those of the past.
No Fallacy	Global warming is largely being driven by emissions from human activities, but a strong El Niño – a natural climate cycle – added to the heat in 2016.
No Fallacy	Arctic sea ice is thicker than ever
No Fallacy	Federal scientists have documented a sharp jump in this nuisance flooding — often called ‘sunny-day flooding’ — along both the East Coast and the Gulf Coast in recent years. The sea is now so near the brim in many places that they believe the problem is likely to worsen quickly.
No Fallacy	The connection between the vanishing Arctic ice and extreme summer weather in the northern hemisphere is probable, according to scientists, but not yet as certain as the winter link.
No Fallacy	You can plug leaks in your home insulation to save power, install a smart thermostat, switch to more efficient light bulbs, turn off unused lights, drive fewer miles by consolidating trips or taking public transit, waste less food, and eat less meat.
No Fallacy	as surface temperatures of the oceans warm up, the immediate response is more water vapor in the atmosphere. We’re in a system inherently capable of producing more floods.
No Fallacy	We almost take forests as a given but we lose forest every year, which means we are diminishing them as a carbon sink.
No Fallacy	An inherent bias in scientific journals in favour of more calamitous predictions has excluded research showing that marine creatures are not damaged by ocean acidification, which is caused by the sea absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. 
No Fallacy	Over the coming 25 or 30 years, scientists say, the climate is likely to gradually warm
No Fallacy	some countries are already talking about banning the sale of gasoline cars after 2030
No Fallacy	there has been no systematic increase in the frequency of extreme weather events,
No Fallacy	Without human intervention, the concentration of CO2 has climbed as high as 7,000 parts per million (ppm) in prior eras, whereas at present the concentration is just over 400 ppm.
No Fallacy	In 2013, scientists reached a consensus that three feet was the highest plausible rise by the year 2100. But now some of them are starting to say that six or seven feet may be possible.
No Fallacy	The planet’s average ground temperature has risen by around 1.62F (0.9C)
No Fallacy	In the U.S. about 9,000 people die from heat each year but 144,000 die from cold.
No Fallacy	Using satellite data rather than tide-gauge data that is normally used to measure sea levels allows for more precise estimates of global sea level, since it provides measurements of the open ocean.
No Fallacy	Climate change? Global warming? What do we call it? […]You can think of global warming as one type of climate change. The broader term covers changes beyond warmer temperatures, such as shifting rainfall patterns.
No Fallacy	there has been no systematic increase in the frequency of extreme weather events,
No Fallacy	More than 100 climate models over the past 30 years did not predict what actually happened because it was assumed carbon dioxide had the pivotal role in driving climate change and that the effects of clouds, back-radiation and the sun were trivial.
No Fallacy	Temperatures in the Southwest increased by nearly two degrees Fahrenheit (one degree Celsius) from 1901 to 2010, and some climate models forecast a total rise of six degrees or more by the end of this century.
No Fallacy	there is no relationship between temperature and carbon dioxide emissions by ­humans
No Fallacy	People tend to think of an ice-free Arctic in summer in terms of it merely being a symbol of global change.
